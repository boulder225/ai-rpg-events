Preface
This is a game that is fun. It helps you
imagine.
“As you whirl around, your sword ready, the
huge, red, fire-breathing dragon swoops
toward you with a ROAR!”

See? Your imagination woke u p already.
Now imagine: This game may be more
fun than any other game you have ever
played!
T h e DUNGEONS & DRAGONS@
game is a way for us to imagine together
- like watching the same movie, o r
reading the same book. Butyou can write
the stories, without putting a word on
paper - j u s t by playing the D&D@
game.
You, along with your friends, will
create a great fantasy story, you will put
it away after each game, and go back to
school or work, but - like a book - the
adventure will wait. It’s better than a
book, though; it will keep going as long
as you like.
It is nearly the most popular game

How to use this book
You can learn how to play the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS@game by yourself, simply by reading the next sections
of this booklet. You don’t have to memorize everything as you read; the first two
adventures are designed to teach you
while you play. If you are ready to learn,
begin reading at Start here.
T h e game is usually played in groups
of 3 or more people. I f you want to learn
with others, it’s best if one person already knows how to play, and can teach
the others. If not, you (or one of the
others) may read the first adventure
aloud, while everyone follows along, to
learn the basics of the game. However,
it’s better if each person can read the
adventures separately.
When you all know how to play characters, read the sections “DUNGEONS
& DRAGONS Characters” and “Playing with a Group”. One person must
also learn how to be a Dungeon Master
(or DM) - the person who plays the
roles of the Monsters. T h e other booklet

ever made. And you will see why, in just
a bit.
When you bought some other game
or book, did you ever think, “Gee, that’s
nice, but it’s not quite what I thought it
would be”? Well, your D&D adventures
will be just what you want, because
you’re the one making them up!
And it’s not hard. It takes a little reading and a little thinking, but most of all,
it’s fun.
It’s fun when you discover that nobody loses, and everybody wins!
It’s fun when you get good at the
game . . . for example, knowing what to
expect in a kobold cave, and which dragons are on your side.
And you don’t have to put in a coin
each time, like many other games. Once
you have these rules, you don’t need
anything else.
There’s more, of course, if you want it:
exciting adventures to play, miniature figures of monsters and characters, expert
rules for more experienced players, and

in this set is the DUNGEON MASTERS
RULEBOOK, and explains everything
the DM needs to know.
This set gives all the details for playing a
DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game. With
these rules, your characters can reach
the 3rd level of experience. (These and
other terms are explained later in this
booklet.) Other sets are available, with
more magic items and spells, monsters,
and rules for bigger and better games.
Set #2 is the D&D@EXPERT Rules,
for character levels 4th through 14th.
T h e D&D@COMPANION Rules is Set
#3, for characters levels 15th through
25th; and the D&D@ MASTERS Set
gives the remaining: details for character
kvels 26th throughv 36th.
Everything in these sets fits together

may use all or part of these rules. They
often include several ways of playing
and running the game. You may create
new rules, monsters, and magic, using
these rules as guidelines.

lots more. But you already have everything you need to start: this package, and
your imagination. That will do it.
Ah, yes; it does cost one more thing,
which you also have right now - a bit of
time. It takes a few minutes to learn the
basic rules, and another hour or two to
play a full game. You will probably want
to spend more time, and might even
make it a hobby; millions of people have.
But for now, just sit back and imagine.
“Your character stands atop a grassy hill . . .
the sun glints off your golden hair, rippling in
the warm breeze . . . you absent-mindedly rub
the gem-studded hilt of your magac sword, and
glance over at the dwarf and elf, bickering as
usual about how to load the horses . . . the
magic-user has memorized her spells, and says
she’s ready to go . . . a dangerous dungeon
entrance gapes at you from the mountain
nearby, and inside, a fearsome dragon awaits.
Time to get moving. . .
Have Fun!

Learning how to play DUNGEONS & DRAGONS” games
Start here
A dungeon is a group of rooms and corridors in which monsters and treasures
can be found. And you will find them, as
you play the role of a character in a fantasy world. T h e r e are many kinds of
monsters, but dragons are the biggest
and most dangerous - and have the
most treasure.
You can start playing this game right
now - without learning any rules, and
without anyone else to play with! Just start
reading, and you will discover the basics of
the game in a matter of minutes.
During your first adventure, you will
only need one of the dice in the box.
The others will be used later, for now all
you need is the roundish one with the
numbers 1 to 20 on it. Use the crayon to
fill in the numbers, and rub off extra
wax with a tissue so only the numbers
are colored in.
After you do that, get a pencil and
paper - and you’re ready to start!
Read this booklet just like any book.
Don’t skip around! This edition has been
completely revised to introduce the
game to you, step by step. While you are
reading the next sections, you will learn
many things about the game. You do not
have to memorize everything as you go
along.
By the time you have played the Solo
Adventure (pages 13-22), you will know
how to play the basic game. T h e rest of
this booklet gives other details that you
wiil need when playing the game with
others.
In group games, one person is the
Dungeon Master, and everyone else is a
player. T h e Dungeon Master (or DM,
for short) runs the game, while the others play the roles of characters. T h e
other booklet in this set, DUNGEON
MASTERS RULEBOOK, gives all the
information needed for running group
games.

What is “role playing”?
This is a role-playing game. That means
that you will be like an actor, imagining
that you are someone else, and pretending
to be that character. You won’t need a
stage, though, and you won’t need costumes or scripts. You only need to imagine.
This game doesn’t have a board, because you won’t need one. Besides, no

board could have all t h e dungeons,
dragons, monsters, and characters you
will need!
For now, while you are learning, you
will play a role in your imagination.
Later, when you play the game with others, you will all be playing different roles
and talking together as if you were the
characters. It will be easy, but first you
need to get ready.

What role will I play?
Imagine: it is another place, another
time. T h e world is much like ours was,
long ago, with knights and castles and no
science or technology - no electricity,
no modern comforts of any kind.
Imagine: dragons are real. Werewolves are real. Monsters of all kinds live
in caves and ancient ruins. And magic
really works!
Imagine: you are a strong hero, a famous but poor fighter. Day by day you
explore the unknown, looking for monsters and treasure. The more you find, the
more powerful and famous you become.
Your character’s basic abilities
In the game, we need some way of describing your character, the fighter you
will pretend to be. We can say the fighter
is “strong, fairly nimble, not too smart”
- but we need to describe the character
a little better than that.
We call these descriptions abilities
(Strength, Intelligence, and others). We
measure each one with a number, called
an “Ability Score.” T h e highest score
possible is 18, and the least is 3 (for reasons we’ll discuss later).
You are a strong fighter; your Strength
score is 17, nearly the highest possible!
You are “fairly nimble,” which means
that you can move swiftly. The name for
this ability is Dexterity. As a fighter, you don’t
need a high Dexterity score. Your Dexterity
is 11 (which is a little above average).
A fighter often isn’t very smart. Your
character isn’t as smart as you are, but isn’t
stupid, either. Let’s say your Intelligence is 9
(which is a little below average).
Now make a note of y o u r Ability
Scores. Anywhere in the middle of your
sheet of paper, write:
17 Strength
11 Dexterity
9 Intelligence
2

You also need equipment for adventuring. You are carrying a backpack and
other items, very similar to what you
would carry when camping. Some of
these items include food, water, rope, a
lantern, and so forth; for now, just assume you have everything you need to
survive in the wilderness.
With monsters around, you need protection! You are wearing armor made of
links of chain (called chain mail) and a
helmet. You own a beautiful sword, and
have a dagger tucked into one boot,just
in case. You know how to use all of your
equipment properly.
If you like, you can give your fighter a
name. It doesn’t matter whether you are
male or female.
All set? Let’s go!

Learning how to play DUNGEONS 8c DRAGONS@games!
Your first adventure
Your home town is just a small place
with dirt roads. You set off one morning
and hike to the nearby hills. There are
several caves in the hills, caves where
treasures can be found, guarded by
monsters. You have heard that a man
named Bargle may also be found in these
caves. Bargle is a sort of bandit, who has
been stealing money, killing people, and
terrorizing your town. If you can catch
him, you can become a hero!
As you approach the entrance, you
look around. It’s a nice day, and everything seems peaceful. You know that
things aren’t usually peaceful in caves
where monsters live, and it’s usually
dark, too. So you get out your lantern
and a tinderbox (matches haven’t been
invented yet, so the box has flint and
steel), and carefully light the wick. T h e
flame sputters a bit, but the oil soon
burns with a soft glow. With your sword
ready, you step into the cave.
It’s dark and musty inside. A passage
leads inward from the entrance, going
deeper into the hill. It looks like the only
way to go, so you head in that direction,
watching carefully for bats and other
nasty creatures.
Suddenly, you see a goblin! H e is
smaller than you are, and looks like an
ugly little man with gray skin. He sees
you, gives a scream, waves his sword,
and attacks! You dodge his blow, and
raise your sword to swing.
If the goblin hadn’t attacked right
away, you might have tried talking to
him; but now you have no choice. You
must fight for your life.
How to hit

In the game, whenever you try to hit a
monster there is a chance that you will
miss - and, of course, a chance that you
will hit. It is very hard for monsters to
hit your fighter, because of your fine
chain mail armor. T h e goblin isn’t as
hard to hit, because his armor is not
nearly as good.
To swing at the monster, you must
make a Hit Roll. Roll the twenty-sided
die. If you roll an 11 or less, your character misses the goblin. If you roll a 12 or
higher, you hit! (This number is part of
the Combat Rules. You will learn more
about it as you continue.)

If you miss, the goblin tries again, but
misses. You can swing again; roll again
to see if you hit.
If you hit the goblin, he screams and
runs away, down the corridor and into
the darkness. (Goblins can see in the
dark.) You have wounded him.
If you keep missing, keep rolling! T h e
goblin is trying to hit you, but you keep
dodging the blows. Remember: if you
hit the goblin, he runs away.
Damage and hit points
In the game, when any creature is hit
(either monster or character), damage is
caused. There is a way of keeping track
of damage, called hit points.
T h e n u m b e r of hit points is t h e
amount of damage that a creature can
take before being killed. Hit points can
be any number; the more hit points a
creature has, the harder it is to kill. We
often use an abbreviation for hit points:
it is hp.
Your fighter starts with 8 h p (hit
points) and still has all 8, since the goblin
never hit you. He may have hit your armor or shield, but never got through
your protection, so these attacks are still
called “misses” - they didn’t actually
damage your character.

You stop for a moment to be sure that
you are all right, and then continue
down the corridor. There are no side
passages, no other way to go.
Ahead, the corridor leads into a wider
area, which we will call a “chamber”. You
carefully approach the chamber, shining
your lantern around to see if anything is
there. A hiss comes from a corner of the
room to your left, and there you see a
huge rattlesnake, almost ten feet long!
Near it, on the floor, are hundreds of
gold and silver coins.

Constitution: Your health
Your fighter is healthy, and can fight a
long time without tiring. This ability is
measured by another Ability Score,
called Constitution. Your Constitution is
16, well above average but not perfect.
Your Constitution affects your hit
points. If you have a low score, you
might only have 2 or 3 hit points. On the
other hand, if you had an 18 Constitution, you might have as many as 10 hp,
or more!
Write your new Ability Score under
the others on your sheet.
16 Constitution
Near the top of the page, above the Ability Scores, make a note of your hit
points:
Hit Points

8

Now back to your adventure:

3

Talking to a snake will do no good at all,
and you can’t just sneak past it. Again,
you must fight. For this battle, you will
keep track of hit points. T h e snake has 3
hp. O n your sheet of paper, near the
bottom, write “Snake 3,” leaving some
room to keep track of t h e snake’s
damage.
This time, you will need to roll an 11
or higher to hit the snake. It’s slower and
easier to hit than the goblin was. But the
snake has a better chance of hitting you
than the goblin did, because it’s bigger
and tougher.
If you hit the snake, cross off the 3
a n d write a 2 next to it; you have
damaged the snake. If you miss, don’t
do anything.
T h e snake then bites at you, and hits!
At the top of the sheet, cross off the 8
after the words “Hit Points,” and write a
7 next to it.
While playing a D&D game by yourself, you should use this method to keep
track of your hit points, and the hit
points of the monster you meet.

Learning how to play DUNGEONS & DRAGONS@games!
Poisoned?
This is a poisonous snake, which can be
very dangerous. In the game, there is a
way of finding our whether the poison
hurt you or not. Roll the twenty-sided
die again. If you roll a 12 or higher, that
means that you dodged before the snake
could inject its poison (but you still take
damage from the bite). If you roll an 11
or less, your fighter takes 2 more points
of damage from the poison (cross off the
7 h p and write 5 ) .
You made this roll to see if you saved
yourself from trouble; this roll is called a
Saving Throw, and will be used later in
many other situations in the game.
Your fighter swings again. Remember,
if you roll an 11 or higher, you hit, and
can subtract 1 hit point from the snake.
If you miss, d o nothing.
T h e snake bites your fighter again!
You lose one more hit point, and must
make another saving throw; remember,
if you roll 12 or higher, you don’t lose
extra points. If you roll an 11 or less, you
lose another 2 hit points from poison
damage.
You can now swing again. If the snake
still lives, it bites and misses. (In this battle, the snake won’t hit any more; in a
regular game, it might kill your fighter
before you hit it at all!)
T h e snake will keep attacking, but it
will keep missing. Your fighter may have
to swing many times, but sooner or later
you will kill the snake. Make all the practice rolls you need.
When the snake’s hit points become
zero, the snake is dead. (If your hit
points ever reach zero, you’re dead!)
You are hurt, but there is nothing you
can do about it right now. T h e damage
your fighter has taken can be healed by a
few days’ rest.
T h e dead snake is not dangerous, so
you get to work. You pick up the many
coins and put them in cloth sacks you
brought with you. As you are doing this,
you notice that, besides the gold, there
are three types of silvery coins. Most are
silver, but others are more valuable metals called electrum and platinum!
This is a rich treasure; snakes usually
have none. T h e treasure probably belonged to someone else who tried to kill
the snake - but failed.
Sometimes treasure could be hidden.
Looking carefully around the room, you

find a small gem, a pearl, in one corner.
It may be worth 100 gold pieces itself!
After resting a bit to catch your
breath, you shine the lantern around,
and see another corridor leading further into the darkness. Looking back the
way you came, you see the light of day
shining in the cave entrance in the distance. It looks tempting, but you remind
yourself that you are a courageous fighter, and shouldn’t run away just because
of a little fighting.
Remember, though, that you are
hurt; if you continue on, beware! If you
see another snake, or something else
that looks as dangerous, you should
probably go back. Don’t get killed! Live
to fight another day; the treasure will
wait.
You carefully start down the corridor
into the unknown, your lantern held
high and sword ready.
The corridor leads to another small
cave. As you approach, you hear a voice,
and see a light.
You pull the shutters closed on your
lantern, so you can hide better, and carefully peek around the corner. To your
right, sitting by the cave wall, is a beautiful woman, wearing armor like yours.
She has no sword, but has a rod with a
metal ball on one end; this is a weapon
called a mace. A lit lantern is on the floor
next to her. She seems to be meditating
or praying.
You decide she might not wish to be
disturbed. But as you try to quietly tiptoe past, she looks u p and says:
“Greetings, friend! Looking for the
goblin? You might - Oh! You are hurt!
May I help?” She watches you carefully,
in case you are dangerous, but seems to
want to help.
You apologize for disturbing her, but
you wonder what she knows about the
goblin, and - most of all - how she
could help you. But wait; she might be
an enemy. Keeping your sword ready,
you move closer. She stands, and says:
“My name is Aleena. I’m a cleric, an
adventurer like yourself. I live in the
town nearby, and came here seeking
monsters and treasure. Do you know
about clerics?”
Stop and imagine what your character
would say. Back in town, she might be
one of your neighbors, you are not sure,
but you don’t know about clerics.
After listening to you, she says, “Well,
the goblin went that-a-way,’’and points
4

toward a corridor leading out of the
room. “He came through here so fast I
almost didn’t see him. You hit him?
Good for you! Goblins are nasty.
“Since you don’t know about clerics,
let me explain. Clerics are trained in
fighting like you, but we can also cast
spells. I meditate, and the knowledge of
spells enters my mind. One of the spells
I can cast right now is a curing spell, and
you look like you need it!”
Spell casting! You’ve heard of it, but
know nothing about it. You are still cautious, but you watch as the cleric says a
few words and touches you lightly on the
arm. Magically, your wounds are healed!

“Feel better?” she asks. “Would you
care to sit and rest a bit? I’d like to tell
you a few things that you will need to
know later.” You sit down, happy to rest,
but keeping your sword handy in case of
trouble. She sits down next to her lantern.
“If you didn’t know about clerics, you
probably don’t know about magic-users.
They are adventurers, like you and me,
but they study only spells, and rarely
fight. They have different spells than we
clerics do, and instead of meditating,
they learn their spells from books.
There are a few magic-users living in
town, but not many.

Learning how to play DUNGEONS 8c DRAGONS@games!
“If you are attacked by a bad magicuser, you might be able to avoid the
magic, but it’s harder than avoiding poison. Spells can be helpful, but they can
be very dangerous, too.
“By the way, that looked like a snake
bite that I cured. That can be very bad,
because most poison is deadly; you
were lucky that it didn’t cause more
damage. Some o t h e r creatures also
have special attacks, like poison. Some
can paralyze, and some can even turn
you to stone by just looking at you unless you look away in time. And
d r a g o n s a r e t h e worst! T h e y can
b r e a t h e fire, acid, o r o t h e r deadly
things. You can never avoid all the
damage from their breaths, but you
can lessen it if you cover u p in time.

Charisma: Your personality
Your fighter gets along fairly well with
the cleric; she was friendly right away.
This is the effect of another Ability
Score: your Charisma. Since your fighter
is a likeable person, your Charisma score
is above average, 14 (remember, 18 is the
best possible). If you had a low score, the
cleric would have been very cautious,
and might not have offered to cure you
at all.
Wisdom, Your common sense
A cleric is very wise. This is another
Ability Score, d i f f e r e n t from intelligence. For example, imagine that you
feel wet drops on your arm. Your Intelligence would tell you that it’s raining;
your Wisdom would tell you to go indoors
to avoid catching a cold.
Your fighter is not very wise; your
Wisdom score is 8. T h e cleric has a
Wisdom of 17, but is fairly weak, with a
Strength of 9. Each type of adventurer
has a different specialty; magic-users,
for example, have high Intelligence, but
often low Strength.
Put these two Ability Scores on your
sheet:
8 Wisdom
14 Charisma

Sharing adventures
As your fighter talks with the cleric, you
get to know each other a little better. She
offers to come along, to help in the adventure. Although this means that the
treasure should be split between you, it
also means that together you can defeat
more dangerous monsters, and find
more treasure. And two adventurers
have a better chance of success than either does alone. You decide that it would
be a good idea, and together you set off
down the next corridor.

Side by side, you quietly walk down the
dark passageway. You see another corridor branching off to the right, about
twenty feet ahead. Keeping your lanterns half-shuttered, so you can see what
you are doing without attracting much
attention, you move up to the corridor
and peek around the corner.
Four beast-like humans in tattered
clothes are standing in a group about ten
feet away, down the side corridor. But
they make no noise at all - quiet as the
dead. They look like they are waiting for
some poor victim to come along.
Before you can speak, t h e cleric
touches your arm, and points back the
way you came. T h e two of you back u p a
few feet so the creatures won’t hear you.
“They’re ghouls!” she whispers. “If
one hits you, it could paralyze you!
Ghouls are undead monsters, very nasty
things; neither dead nor alive, but something horribly in between. We clerics
have some power over these creatures of
darkness. Follow me, and wish for luck.”
You move forward again, but with the
cleric leading the way. Peeking around
the corner, you see the ghouls. Luckily,
they don’t seem to have heard your
whispers. The cleric pulls a necklace out
from under her armor, and you see that
there is a symbol of one of the town
churches on her silver chain. She boldly
steps out, holds u p the symbol, and says
harshly “BEGONE, vile things!”
When she steps o u t , the ghouls
quickly turn to attack. But now, as she
thrusts t h e symbol o u t , t h e ghouls
pause; and suddenly, in a rush, they
scramble away down the side corridor,
into the darkness, and all in dead silence.
“‘Don’t bother to chase them,” she
mutters. “As I said, they can be quite

5

dangerous, and we should continue on
our way. I was lucky to Turn them, and it
might not work again.”
As you continue down the corridor together, she explains. “We call this ‘Turning Undead’, you see. Only clerics can
d o it, and sometimes it doesn’t work.
Ghouls are only one of many kinds of
undead monsters; there are also skeletons, zombies, and much worse. If you
had been alone, you could easily have
been ambushed, and probably slain.
“Let’shurry, because the Turning only
lasts for a few minutes. There are too
many of them for us to handle.”

You see a door ahead, to the right. This
is unusual in caves, and you approach it
slowly and quietly. T h e corridor continues past it, into the darkness.
Together you examine the door. It is
made of wood, with heavy iron bands
across it; the hinges seem to be on the
other side. A large keyhole is below the
curved metal handle.
“I don’t see anything dangerous,” says
the cleric, “but then, I don’t know much
about the traps you sometimes find on
doors. It’s worth a try.” She tries to open
it, but the door seems to be locked.
“Could you try to force it open?” she
asks.
You back u p a bit and, with a short
run, slam into the door. But try as you
might, you can’t break it open.
“What a pity!” m u r m u r s Aleena.
“There is probably some nice treasure in
there, but we can’t get to it. We need a
thief!”

Learning how to play DUNGEONS 8c DRAGONS@games!
Seeing the puzzled look on our face,
she explains. “You may think that thieves
a r e bad, but many of them aren’t.
Thieves are adventurers too; some of
them are quite nice folks, really. You do
have to keep an eye on your coin purse,
but a thief can be very helpful finding
traps, opening locks, climbing walls, and
doing other things.
“I’m sure we could do better if we had
a thief along, and a magic-user could
help, too. I usually go adventuring with
those types, plus a couple of big fighters
like you to handle the rough stuff. Unfortunately, nobody else wanted to come
along this time.
You try the door again, but it won’t
open. So, with a sigh of regret, the two
of you continue down the corridor.
T h e corridor curves to the left, and
you see a light ahead. You stop and listen, and hear voices. One sounds like a
man, but the other sounds like a goblin.
“ G e t UP, you wimpy weakling!”
growls the man. “Who else did you see,
besides this fighter and a cleric!”
“Please, master! Don’t hurt!” whimpers the goblin. “Nobody else, nobody. I
hurt the fighter real bad. I come to tell
you right away!”
T h e goblin’s lies don’t seem to fool the
human. “Get UP, I say, or I’ll turn you
into a toad. You probably ran away without even trying. Nobody else, you’re
sure?”
“Nobody else, master, I swear!”
“Hrmph. They could still mean trouble. Perhaps we can trick them, and kill
them without a fight. . .”
Aleena taps your arm once again, and
you back up to discuss the situation.
“I recognize that man’s voice!” she
says. “It’s Bargle, o n e of those bad
magic-users. He has probably cast a spell
on the goblin to force it to serve him.
“If we go back, we should be safe. Oh!
I almost forgot. T h e ghouls are back
there. If Bargle only has one goblin, we
should risk this battle, rather than face
all those Undead. Besides, he’s not ready
for us - yet.”
Listening carefully, you h e a r t h e
magic-user and the goblin planning how
to trick you and Aleena. T h e two of you
also make plans. T h e magic-user is the
most dangerous, and Aleena will try to
fight his spells with hers. Your job is to
fight the goblin.
As your return, you hear a spell being
cast up ahead. You peek around the cor-

ner, and see a tall bearded human in a
black robe standing in a room. A goblin
is crouched by one wall, watching. T h e
robed magic-user is moving his hands
and saying works you don’t understand
- and suddenly he disappears!
T h e goblin crackles with glee, and
says “Ah, master, it worked! Nobody can
see you now, and what a surprise those
nasty people will have. And I’m next!
Make me invisible too, master!”
T h e cleric whispers, “Now! Before
they can do any more!” And you charge
into the room together.
T h e goblin jumps u p and meets your
charge with a swing of its sword. It
misses!

As you battle the goblin, Aleena looks
wildly around for the invisible magicuser, waving her mace to and fro in the
air. It seems to hit something, and you
hear a deep grunt. She keeps waving her
mace, but without further success, so she
stops and casts a spell. You don’t see
what her spell does, so you concentrate
on fighting.

Aleena can’t find Bargle, and is starting to look worried. Suddenly, the sound
of a spell comes from a far corner of the
room! The cleric turns and runs in that
direction, waving her mace and shouting. the black-robed magic-user appears
in the same corner as the spell noise,
with a glowing arrow floating in the air
beside him. He points at Aleena; the arrow shoots out, and hits her! She wails
and falls with a sigh, collapsing in the
middle of the room. T h e glowing arrow
disappears.

If your fighter hasn’t slain the goblin yet,
roll again. But while you are swinging,
6

the goblin hits you again, causing 2 more
points of damage. Remember to keep
track of hit points for both the goblin
and your fighter.
If your hit points reach zero, the enemies win this battle. You will not see
home again.
If you are still fighting, the magic-user
stays back in the corner, thinking about
what spell to throw next. Roll again; the
goblin keeps missing.
T h e goblin started the battle with 2 hit
points. So the second time you hit the
creature, his hit points reach zero, and
he shrieks and falls dead on the floor.
You have overcome one enemy, but the
magic-user remains!
When the goblin falls, the magic-user
starts looking worried. Watching you
carefully, he starts saying magic words
and waving his hands. He’s casting a
spell at you.
You run at him, hoping for a chance
to swing before he can complete the
spell. But it’s too late - a magical force
touches your mind.
Roll the die once again. You must
make a Saving Throw against the spell.
If you roll a 16 or less, the magic takes
effect; read the next section, Ending #I
for this adventure. If you roll a 17 or
higher, your fighter avoids the spell;
skip to Ending #2 on page 8.

Ending #1: YOU MISS THE
SAVING THROW

As you get near the magic-user, a funny
feeling comes over you. Why, he doesn’t
look so bad; in fact, Bargle seems to be a
pretty nice guy! You think you used to
be friends, but you are not sure just
where or when.
“Feeling better?” he asks. “You were
overcome with rage for a moment. Are
you okay now?”
“Sure,” you reply, somewhat confused. “You seem to be okay, Bargle old
pal, and I only took a little damage from
that goblin. Say, I saw some ghouls back
there; we should get moving.”
“Indeed?” replies Bargle. “Well, let’s
pack u p the goodies, and move on.”
Together you collect the treasure: a
small bag from the goblin, and a larger
one from the cleric. Bargle picks u p a
black velvet bag, explaining that he
dropped it while he was fighting the
goblin.
As you get ready to leave, you blurt
out “Shouldn’t we take the cleric’s body
back? She helped me out, earlier.”
“That would be nice,” Bargle replies,
“but we’re carrying all we can. We all
take our risks, here in the dungeon.”
Something seems wrong about that.
You argue with Bargle a bit, but he
convinces you that nothing could be
done for her, and bringing her along
could slow you down - maybe enough
that the ghouls would catch up. So you
head off down the corridor, as if the best
of friends.
T h e corridor leads to another room,
which is empty. You search it together;
nothing can be found. But looking down
the next passage, you see a light!
“Bargle!” you exclaim. “Look here!”
“Ah, I see,” he says. “That must be a
way out! We’re in good shape now. Lead
on, fierce fighter! I shall watch for the
ghouls.”
You head down the corridor towards
the light. Sure enough, it’s a side
passage, leading out of the hill into the
sunlight. As your stomach grumbles,
you remember that it’s after noon. You
missed lunch in all the excitement.
“Shall we head back?” you ask, as you
squint out into the daylight, much
brighter than your lantern.
“Surely!” he replies. As you head outside, you start to talk about how hungry

you are. Bargle’s reply isn’t in a language
you can understand; you stop and turn,
and see him softly chanting a spell,
waving his hands at you. Before you can
ask what’s going on, you begin to feel
very sleepy. Everything goes black.

*

*

*

Something lands on your face, and you
start to wake up. Opening your eyes, you
see - a leaf, apparently fallen from the
tree above you. You are lying by a cave,
and it’s late afternoon. You can make it
back to town if you hurry. But suddenly,
you remember what happened - BARGLE! T h e fight with the goblin, Aleena
falling, the strange bad-but-nice feeling
about the magic-user - Horrors! You
were ENCHANTED! And where is the
treasure?
You get up quickly, brushing the
leaves off your face and equipment.
Perhaps Bargle was afraid to kill you,
and just stole all that he could find. Or,
more likely, Bargle was scared away by
something before he could slit your
throat.
Your dagger is missing, and some
food, but your sword is in its sheath and
your pack is still there. One sack remains, and from the pain in your back,
you must have been sleeping on it. It
contains some of the coins you found by
the snake and the tiny gem. T h e rest is
missing.
You remember what happened to
poor Aleena. You should take her back
to town; they might be able to help, and
even if it’s too late, she should get a
proper burial. As you prepare to return
to the caves, you find that your lamp has
gone out, the oil all burned away.
There is still one oil flask in your pack,
so you refill the lantern, light it with
your tinderbox, and head back into the
darkness.
You pass through one empty room,
and then find the bodies of the cleric
and the goblin in the next. But you see
dark, quiet shapes in the darkness
beyond; it’s the ghouls! Quickly, you put
the cleric’s body over your shoulder and
run for your life.
The ghouls follow, snapping at your
heels. You can’t move as fast as usual
with the weight of the cleric on your
shoulder. But you win the desperate
race, and get outside once again!
You pause for a moment, out of
breath. Looking back, you see the ghouls
in the cave - but they don’t seem to be

7

coming out. T h e n you remember
Aleena’s words, “creatures of darkness.”
Maybe they hate the sunlight, and only
come outside at night. You’d better hurry, to get back to town before dark.

It’s hard to run with the cleric across
your shoulder, but you finally get back
just as the sun goes down. Once there,
you take her body to her church. It’s too
late to help her, but they can give her a
proper burial. They thank you for your
kindness, and offer a small bottle as a
reward.
“What is it?” you ask.
“It’s a magical potion, of course!” he
exclaims. “It’s a Potion of Healing. If you
are hurt, you can drink this and be
cured, somewhat like our magical curing
spells. It’s a nice magical treasure; save it
for an adventure in your future, in case
a cleric you are traveling with runs out
of spells. It’s the least we can do.”
T h e clerics thank you again for your
help, and you thank them for theirs. You
leave the church and head for your
home on the other side of town, thinking about your adventure and all you
have learned.

Now pretend that you made the Saving
Throw, and read the next section to see
what might have happened.
If you have already read the next
section, skip to the Winning section afterward.

It won’t spoil; save it for an adventure in
your future.”
T h e clerics thank you again for your
help, and you thank them for theirs. You
leave the church and head for your
home on the other side of town, thinking about your adventure and all you
have learned.

Ending #2: YOU MAKE THE
SAVING THROW
Bargle’s magic doesn’t seem to work! He
pauses, surprised, as you swing.

If you hit, the magic-user gives a cry
and falls, dead. You have won!
If you miss, Bargle screams and runs
down the next corridor, into the darkness. You start after him, but then you
stop. Who knows what magical powers
the man might have, waiting there to
trap you? Better to see if Aleena is alive,
and rest a bit.
You kneel by the cleric, and gently
turn her over. Alas, Bargle’s magical
spell has taken her life. Mourning the
loss of your new-found friend, you decide to take her back to town for a
proper burial. You tidy her up while
keeping an eye out for monsters and
listening carefully in case Bargle come:
back; but nothing happens.
T h e goblin had very little treasure,
just a few copper pieces in a small bag.
Searching the room, you find another
bag, a finer one of black velvet. It must
be Bargle’s, dropped in the heat of the
battle! Opening it, you find several valuable gems and a small bottle. You put the
treasure away, planning to examine the
bottle later.
Nothing else of value is in the room.
You pick up the poor cleric and carry
her on one shoulder. Should you continue down the dark corridor, or head
back the way you came?
You suddenly see shadowy shapes approaching from the way you came. T h e
ghouls must have returned! Now there
is no choice; you must hope that the
magic-user ran away, and that a way out
lies in that direction. Fighting the ghouls
would mean your death.
You stagger under the weight, but
manage to run down the corridor, holding your lantern shakily with one finger.
You enter a room, but it looks empty. No
time to search; you continue onward. As
you head into the next corridor, you see
light ahead! And as you approach, you
see that it’s coming from a side passage.

If you haven’t read Ending #1, “You
Miss The Saving Throw” go back and
do that now, pretending that you were
enchanted by Bargle’s spell.

I

Peering into it, you find that the corridor leads outside, into the midday sun.
Carefully, in case Bargle is waiting to
ambush you, you walk outside - and all
is clear and calm.
You rest a bit, pick up the cleric, and
head back to town. Once there, you take
her body to her church. It’s too late to
help her, but they can give her a proper
burial. They thank you for your kindness, and offer a favor in return. You
remember the strange small bottle in
Bargle’s bag, and get it out, asking
whether they can tell you what it is.
One of the clerics opens the bottle,
and sniffs at it. “Why, it seems to be a
magical potion!” he exclaims. “Let me
see, now, I’m sure I’ve smelled that
before. Ah! I remember. It’s a potion of
Growth! If you drink it, you will become
a giant for a short time, for one to two
hours - and can do double normal
damage when you hit a monster. Congratulations, it’s a nice magical treasure!

You have just played a D&D game!
This adventure was designed to show
you some of the basic parts of the game.
You played a fighter, who tried to survive in the dungeon, while finding monsters and treasures. You succeeded - SO
your character “wins.”
Think a moment. Why do we play
games? To have fun. Each player “wins”
by having fun - so if you had a good
time, you win! You can have fun even if
your character gets killed - and if that
happens, don’t worry. You can always
make up another one!
Winning a role playing game is like
“winning” in real life; it’s just succeeding
in doing what you wanted to do, and
living through it. T h e fun comes from
doing it, not ending it! This is why we
say that in this game, everybody wins
and nobody loses.
Is this a game or a story, you ask? It’s a
little of both. As you learn more about it,
it will become more and more like a
game. You still have many game details
to learn, so continue reading.
You have met some monsters, and
won the battles. You have found some
treasures - not only coins and gems,
but a magical potion.
Most important, you have learned
how to use your own imagination, while
using the rules of the game. Could you
see, in your mind, the wicked magic-user
Bargle? Or the kind, wise cleric Aleena?
Can you imagine the gold and silver
scattered on the floor by the huge,
deadly rattlesnake - and the fierce battle afterward?
This is another part of the fun in a
DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game.

Your character

r

Ali ment: How characters
an monsters behave
Take a moment, now, and think about
how your character behaved. T h e
fighter was one of the “good guys.” You
wanted to d o the right things; for example, you brought the cleric back home
with you. On the other hand, the magicuser and the goblin were the “bad guys.”
They didn’t care whether you lived or
died, just what they could get from you
- selfish, and nasty besides.
There is a way to describe how your
character behaves in the game; it is
called Alignment. Your fighter’s Alignment is called Lawful, he tries to protect
others and defeat monsters.
Aleena the cleric was also Lawful.
This is one reason why you became
friends. Your Charisma helped when
you first met her, but if your Alignments
were different, you probably wouldn’t
have been so friendly to each other.
Bargle, the magic-user, had a different Alignment than yours. He was
Chaotic, the opposite of Lawful. He was
selfish, cared only about himself and
steals from others. Most people don’t
like chaotic’s. You two wouldn’t normally
become friends at all (except for the
spell he cast, that magically forced you to
be his friend for a short time).
Monsters have alignments, too. The
goblin and the ghouls were Chaotic. But
the snake wasn’t really bad or good (although it certainly was dangerous). Its
Alignment is called Neutral. It will fight to
protect itself and will help others, if that
will help it, but is mostly concerned with
surviving. Neutral doesn’t mean stupid
(Alignment has nothing to do with Intelligence); it means a balance, an average
between the Law and Chaos. The snake
wasjust a typical animal, trying to stay alive
and get something to eat.
Alignment will be explained in more
detail later in this booklet, on page 5 5 .

Now where do you go?
You can have more adventures by yourself! Another adventure has been designed just for your fighter. It starts on
page 13. But before you play that adventure, you will need to know a few more
details about your fighter, and how to
use all the dice.
All the details of your character your hit points, Ability Scores, Saving

Throws, and so forth - are written
down for you on a sheet in the middle of
this booklet, along with other details.
This description of your character is
called a Character Sheet.
Remove the character sheet by carefully folding it along the dotted line and
then tearing it along the perforation.
You will find the scores for other
character types in the center of this
booklet too. These are for when you
play with a group. You will have to write
the information on copies of the blank
character sheet on the back of this book.
Do not use any of these characters for
the Solo Adventure in this booklet.
Use a pencil whenever you need to
write on a character sheet, not a pen.
Many of the notes you will make are
temporary, like the amount of money you
have, your equipment, and so forth.
Get out the rest of the dice and the
crayon. If you have the dice, the crayon,
a pencil, and your character sheet, you
are ready to learn some more.

The Character Sheet
Let’s look at the whole character sheet,
bit by bit.
At the top of the sheet, fill in your
name above “Player’s Name.”
What’s your character’s name? It
could be the same as yours, or you could
make one up. Write the name in the
place for it, under your own.
Your fighter is one of the “good guys,”
so your Alignment is Lawful. This has
already been filled in on your sheet, and
shouldn’t change. If you want to play a
Neutral character (or, if you want to take
the chance, a Chaotic one), you should
put the Alignment on the character
sheet for that new character.
T h e Class of your character is the
type of adventurer you are playing.
Fighter has already been filled in, because once a Class is chosen, it will never
change.
You are just starting, so your Level is
1, or “first” (1st). You will learn more
about a character’s “level” very soon.
Armor Class is a measure of how
hard it is for monsters to hit you; abbreviated AC. It can be any whole number,
9 or less. T h e lower the number, the
smaller the chances are that you will get
hit. Since your fighter is wearing sturdy
armor, your Armor Class is 4; write that
number in the shield shape.
9

In the box above the words Hit
Points, put 8. You should know what
that means, from your first adventure.
It’s a measure of how much damage
your fighter can take.
At the top right corner, there is a
place for the name of your Dungeon
Master. In group games, this is the person who plays the monsters, while you
play your character. You don’t have one
yet, so leave that blank. Later, when
you’re playing in a group, one person
will be the Dungeon Master.
Below that line is a rectangle labeled
Character Sketch or Symbol. You may
wish to draw a picture of your character
there, a “character sketch.” You may skip
this part of the character sheet, if you
wish; it won’t affect the game, but might
help you imagine what your character
looks like. O r instead of a sketch, you
may want to pick a symbol - something
that your character will be connected
with. Your symbol could be a bird, or a
tree, or anything you wish. For example,
if your character’s name is Hawk, you
may wish to draw a falcon-like bird in
this rectangle.
T h e middle part of the character
sheet gives all your Ability Scores and
Saving Throws.

Ability Scores
Let’s take a closer look at your character.
Your fighter has the following Ability
Scores:
17
9
8
11
16
14

Strength
Intelligence
Wisdom
Dexterity
Constitution
Charisma

In the adventure, it said “your Ability
Score is . . . ,” because your starting
character was already made up. Later, if
you would like to play another character,
you can use any of the others included in
this booklet. But when you are ready to
make u p a completely new character,
you will roll for your Ability Scores,
using the dice. This is explained in more
detail on page 48.
Every D&D character has these six
Ability Scores (though the numbers are
usually different, of course). The numbers are always from 3 to 18, the total of
three six-sided dice.

Your character
Adjustments
There is a place on the sheet for “adjustments” next to your Ability Scores. If
any Ability Score is very high o r low,
there may be adjustments, which can be
good o r bad. T h e adjustments will apply
to certain die rolls in the game. An
“average” Ability Score is any number
from 9 to 12, and has no adjustments.
Strength: With a low Strength score, it
would be harder to hit monsters, and
you would have a “minus” adjustment, a
penalty. But your great Strength gives
you a bonus, the “plus” adjustment.
Your + 2 bonus helps you in fighting; it
is added to both your Hit Rolls and to
the Damage you do. It also helps when
you try to perform feats of strength like breaking open a stuck door, or
lifting a huge rock.
T h e 2 adjustment has already been
included in your Hit Rolls for the Solo
Adventures in this booklet.

+

Intelligence: Your Intelligence is average so there are no adjustments here.
Because of your intelligence, your character can speak two languages. You can
speak the same language as all the other
humans, which we call “Common.”
Your fighter can also speak a code
l a n g u a g e , called a n “ A l i g n m e n t
Tongue.” This is used to speak privately
with someone else of the same Alignment. (In your first adventure, you
could have spoken to Aleena the cleric in
the Lawful tongue, a n d Bargle the
magic-user wouldn’t have understood
what you were saying; he speaks Chaotic.) Characters usually don’t use their
Alignment tongue unless they have to.
You can say that you speak “Common”
and “Lawful.” Near the bottom of the
sheet is a place to write the names of
your languages.
Wisdom: Your Wisdom is 8, just below
average, so you have a penalty adjustment
of - 1. As with your Strength bonus, your
Wisdom penalty has been included in the
Solo adventure to come.
In group games, you will subtract one
from your die roll each time you make a
Saving Throw against a magic spell.
Aleena the cleric had a bonus against
magic spells, because of her high Wisdom,
but she had a penalty on her Hit rolls,
because of her low Strength score.

Dexterity: Your Dexterity is average, so
there are no adjustments here. If you
were clumsy (with a low Dexterity score),
you would have trouble using missile
weapons like bow and arrow (which you
will learn about later in this booklet).
You might also react a little slower than
the monsters. But your average score
here keeps you even with them.
Constitution: Your Constitution score is
high, so you get a 2 bonus here. As we
explained in the adventure, you have 8
hit points; without your good Constitution, you would only have 6 hit points. If
you had a low Constitution score, you
might have even less. A higher Constitution score would mean more hit points.

this is not a “special ability.” Most other
characters can’t fight as well, but have
Special Abilities which they need for
survival and success. T h e Special Abilities of each character class are given in
the class descriptions (pages 23 - 47).

+

Charisma: Your Charisma is also above
average, and you get a + 1 bonus when
meeting and talking to others. Your
Charisma will affect their reactions; they
will probably like you, and you can probably get your own way a little more
often, because of your Charisma bonus.
As with your other bonuses, your
Charisma bonus has been accounted for
in the Solo Adventure to come.

Saving Throws
In the first adventure, you made Saving
Throws against poison and magic spells.
When you try to save yourself from a
special attack, you roll the twenty-sided
die; if the result is equal to or higher
than your number you succeed in avoiding the attack.
There are three other Saving Throws,
against Magic Wands (if someone shoots
one at you), Paralysis (which would have
been used if one of the ghouls had hit
you), and Dragon Breath (dragons can
be very dangerous, so there weren’t any
in your first adventure). You will always
use a twenty-sided die to roll a Saving
Throw.
For most characters, the easiest Saving
Throws to make are those against Poison
and Magic Wands, and the hardest are
those against Dragon Breath and Magic
Spells. Saving Throws are explained in
more detail in the Dungeon Masters
Rulebook.

Special Abilities
Your character does a better job at fighting than any other type of character, but
10

Combat Chart
You know how to roll when your character wants to hit a monster; this is called a
“Hit Roll.” You will always use a twentysided die for Hit Rolls.
You will not need to use this Combat
Chart until you play in a group game.
When you read a one-player adventure,
the Hit Roll you need will be given. This
will include your Strength adjustment as
well as the monster’s Armor Class.
In group games, you will use a slightly
different procedure, using this chart. In
the D&D combat system, every creature
has an Armor Class, whether it is wearing armor or not. If your roll (including
the Strength adjustment) is a number
high enough to match or beat the number listed under the target’s Armor
Class, you will hit the target, and can
then roll Damage. This will be explained
in more detail later.
TURN T H E SHEET OVER
We are done with the hardest parts, but
there are a few more things to come. Be
very careful when you get to “Money”
and “Experience.”

Your character
Magic Items
Whenever you find a magic item, write it
down here. This includes the magic potion you found in your first adventure!
In this box, write Potion of Healing - the
magic item you found in Ending # l .
(Since you probably missed the Saving
Throw against Bargle’s spell, we will use
that ending for your character’s adventure. You will need the Potion of Healing
in your next adventure.)

Normal Items
This is where you list the equipment that
your character has. Copy the following
list into the box, and look it over so you
know what you are carrying. For now,
don’t worry about how much the items
cost or where they came from.
You have a dagger and other normal
equipment again, even though Bargle
stole some. We will assume that you kept
spare equipment at home - but the list
here is all that remains.

goblin. You brought home a little of
each, though Bargle stole most of it.
This is where you make a note of the
treasure you have, adding to the list for
any more treasure you find. We use
abbreviations for the types of coin (listed
here in order, starting with the most
valuable):
platinum pieces = pp
gold pieces = gp
electrum pieces = ep
silver pieces = sp
copper pieces = cp

Other Notes
This is a way to help you remember who
your character has met, and where you
have gone. You should write down
“Caves near town; met Bargle, Chaotic
magic-user.’’ Make more notes as you
play more adventures.

Money and Treasure

you should get to know them well. To

100 gp

To find the Total value (200 gp), you
need to know more about the D&D
money system.
Think of copper as pennies, silver as
dimes, and gold as dollars. Electrum
pieces are like half dollars, but platinum
is expensive; one platinum piece is like a
five-dollar bill. Study the Money Conversion Table on this page.

MONEY CONVERSION TABLE

100 cp = 1 gp
2 ep = 1 gp
10 sp = 1 gp
5 gp = 1 pp
1 pp = 5 gp = 1 0 e p = 5 0 s p = 500cp
When you find treasure in an adventure, write it down on a separate piece of
paper. A t the end of the adventure, add
the treasure to your list, and figure out
your new total.
In your adventures, look for the most
valuable treasure. If you are carrying all
you can, you may have to drop some
treasure to pick u p more valuable coins;
drop copper first, of course.

Your character
Experience
In the game, your character will become
more powerful each time you complete an
adventure. The way of measuring this
“power” is another number, called Experience Points; the abbreviation is XP.
When your character started, you had
no Experience Points. But in your first
adventure, you killed a giant snake and a
goblin, and found some treasure. You get
Experience Points for each of these things.
For the treasure you found, you get
200 XP. (one experience point per gold
piece value). For killing the monsters,
you get 30 more. That adds up to 230
XP, but it’s not your total. You also get a
bonus because you are a Fighter and
have an above average Strength score.
This bonus is + l o % of your XP. Since
you earned 230, you get 23 bonus
points, for a total of 253 XP. In the
Experience box at the bottom of the
page, write “253.”

Dice
This is a very important section
Be sure to read it carefully.
When you have several dice, they are
just called “dice” - but one is called a
“die.” Each side of a die is called a “face.”
Each type of die is named for the number of faces it has. T h e dice, and the
abbreviations for them, are used in
every adventure, so you should get to
know them well.
Check to be sure your set has all the
dice you need:
The four-sided die looks like a pyramid. Try to spin it as you throw it, to be
sure of making a fair roll. When it lands,
only the bottom number on each face is
right-side up; this is the result of the
“roll.” For all the other dice, roll them on
a table or flat surface, and the number
on top is the result of the roll.
T h e ten-sided die has a zero on one
face, which is read as “ten.”
The ten-sided die can also be used to
find a Percentage (a number from 1 to
loo), in the following way. Roll the die
once and read the result as the “tens”

experience for treasure, and not much
for killing monsters? It’s better to avoid
killing, if you can, by tricking monsters
or using magic to calm them down. You
can sometimes avoid the risks of combat.
But you will have to fight many monsters to get their treasures.
Remember your “Level” at the top of
the front of the sheet? That relates to XP
(Experience Points) in the following
way; if you gain enough experience
points your level goes up.
When your Level goes up, you become more powerful. Each time this
happens, you will get more Hit Points.
Sometimes (but not every time) when
your Level goes up, your character will
be able to make Saving Throws a little
easier, and hit things a little more often.
So the more Levels you gain, the longer
you can survive, and the more treasures
you can collect.
On the line at the bottom of the
Experience box, write the number
“2,000.” This is your goal. When you

EIGHT-SIDED d8

finally have this many XP, adding up
your points from each and every adventure, your character will no longer be
Level 1; you will move u p in power, to
Level 2. This doesn’t mean that you lose
any XP; you will keep adding more as
you get them.
You will probably work your way up to
Level 3,4, 5 and so forth, becoming more
powerful each time. And human characters can go all the way to 36th level,
though this should take hundreds of
games. For low level your goal doubles for
each Level: 4,000 XP for 3rd Level, 8,000
XP for 4th Level, and so forth.
Now you should know how to use each
part of your Character Sheet. If you
didn’t understand something, STOP!
Go back and read the details again.
You will have a character sheet for
each character you play. It will have all
the details you need to play the character properly.

number, counting zero as “no tens.” Roll
a second time for the “ones” number.
If both rolls are “zero”, the result is
one hundred.

roll two 4-sided dice at once, adding the
results normally.
Some examples:
d%
4d8
9d12

Now stop and color in the numbers on
all the other dice by rubbing the crayon
across the grooves and using a tissue to
wipe off the extra way.
We often use abbreviations for the kinds
of dice: a “d,” followed by the number of
faces. For example: d8 means an eightsided die.
T h e roll of a ten-sided die twice, to
find a Percentage, is abbreviated “d%,”
and sometimes called a “Percentage roll”
or “Percentage dice.”
Whenever a number appears before
the “d,” it means the number of times
you need to roll the die. So “2d4” means
“roll a four-sided die twice, and add the
results,” for a total of 2-8. Or, if you have
more than one set of dice, you can just
12

TWENTY-SIDED d20

ld20

Roll the ten-sided die to find
the “tens” number, and again
to find the “ones” number.
Roll an eight-sided die four
times
Roll the twelve-sided die nine
times
Roll the twenty-sided die once

Sometimes you will find a number after
the “d” that’s not a kind of die; for
example, ld3. In this case, it means that
the result should be 1, 2, or 3. To make a
“ld3” roll, roll ld6 and divide by 2
(rounding up), to get a result from one
to three.
Using the same principle, you can
find the result of ld2 (ld4 divided by 2)
and ld5 (ld10 divided by 2).
If you have read everything so far YOU ARE READY FOR YOUR NEXT
ADVENTURE!
To Start, just turn the page.

Solo adventure
In the following one-player adventure,
you will explore a dungeon, looking for
monsters and treasures. Part 1 is a shopping trip in town. In Part Z,.you will
learn more about battles. And in Part 3
you will visit the dungeon. You will often
be given choices, and asked to pick one.
Each choice gives a.number; turn to that
number to find the results of your
choice. Your adventure will continue
from there.

Part 1: Town Business
You spend a few days in town, letting
your wounds heal. Since you found so
much treasure on your first adventure,
you go shopping for some better armor.
Armorer Baldwick knows you well.
He’s a jolly fellow, getting a bit gray. You
remember snitching apples from the big
tree in his yard when you were young
and foolish.
“Well, well!” he booms, as you enter
his shop. “How have YOU been these
days? All grown u p now, I see!”
You chat for a few minutes about your
younger days, and then you ask if he has
any armor that would fit you.
“Why, surely! Let me see, let me see
. . .” He pushes his way through racks of
armor of all kinds, as you follow closely
behind. There are dozens of sets of
armor, for people of all sizes, but most of
them need repair.
“AHA!” h e exclaims, pulling an
armload of metal down. “Try this on!”
T h e armor you are wearing is made
of round chain links, all skillfully interwoven to form a covering for most of
your body. But this armor is different.
Large pieces of well-crafted metal are
fastened to chain mail and leather, fashioned into pieces that you could wear.
“Plate mail, of course; just finished it a
week or two ago. Want to try it on? I
think it’ll fit.”
You go to a back room and remove
your chain mail, and try this heavier
armor on for size. Sure enough, it fits,
almost as if it were made just for you.
T h e metal plates hang from leather
straps and chain mail links, forming a
tough protective suit. But it’s very heavy,
almost twice as heavy as your chain mail.
You come out to show him, and he
walks around you, carrying a piece of
charcoal and marking the armor here
and there for some necessary adjustments.

“Looks good!” he exclaims. “Just a bit
here, and a bit there. . . want to trade in
that chain mail you had on? Looked to
be in pretty good shape . . . .”
“Wait a minute!” you reply. “Don’t you
have anything lighter than this stuff? I’m
not going to be able to carry as much
treasure if I wear all this metal!”
“Ah, well!” he says, soothingly. “If you
want better protection, you have to use
this. Unless, of course, you can somehow
find magical armor.”
Plate mail will improve your Armor
Class to AC 2, better than your current
AC 4,so it would be nice to have.
“Well, how much?” you ask.
“Well. . . 7 5 gold pieces as is. Want to
trade in that chain mail?” he repeats.
“Oh, I guess so,” you reply. “How
much?”
“For you, well . . . since you’re trying
to get started, and since I’ve known you
so long . . . 50 gold pieces, with your
trade-in.”
You talk with him a bit more, using
your Charisma, and bargain him down
to a better price.
“Okay, OKAY!” he says finally. “Just
30 gold pieces with the trade-in, and you

13

promise to come here first the next time
you need better armor or more weapons. Agreed!” He stomps off, grumbling, then stops and turns. “You can
pick it u p Tuesday. Pay the clerk on your
way out!”
Subtract 30 gold pieces worth of coins
from the Money on your character
sheet. You can either subtract it from
your gp, or use some coins of lesser
value if you understand the Conversion
Table. Change the numbers on your
sheet to account for your spending, and
change your Equipment List. Then turn
the sheet over, and change your Armor
Class to 2.
You come back to the shop in a few
days and pick u p your heavy Plate Mail
(it’s not ready on Tuesday, but you have
time to wait). You spend the time looking around for other adventurers - any
help would be welcome - but the few
you find all just want to relax, have a
good time, and heal up from their last
adventures.
So, fully equipped but still alone, you
set off one morning for the caves near
town, remembering to watch out for
ghouls.

Solo adventure
Part 2: Battles
You are almost ready to enter the “dungeon.” But first, you need to learn a little
more about battles.
You already know how to swing at a
monster:
You roll ld20 (a twenty-sided die),
and compare the result to the Hit roll
given in the description. If you rolled
that number or higher, you hit the
enemy, and roll Damage.

More Damage!
In your first adventure, each time you
hit a monster you.did 1 point of damage.
However, from now on, you will roll ld6
(a six-sided die) to see how much
damage you d o to the creature you are
fighting.
You will keep track of the damage in
the same way, writing down the starting
number and subtracting the damage
each time you hit. Just cross off the old
number of hit points, and write down
the new number.

The Monsters

Combat Checklist
A step-by-step list of everything you
need to do when fighting a monster is
given on the same page as the monster
description (the boxed information).
Use this checklist for every battle, to be
sure you are running each one correctly.

Record Keeping
Use a piece of scrap paper to keep track of
the battles. Whenever you find some treasure, write down the amount and type on
the same paper. Experience points will be
given at the end of the adventure, but you
will need a list of the creatures your fighter
conquers. All the points for treasure and
experience will be added up at the end of
the adventure.

Getting Killed

Monsters will also be able to do more
damage. In your one-player games, you
will keep track of their damage on a
separate sheet of paper along with your
own. In group games, the Dungeon
Master keeps trac.k of all the monster
details.
Some monsters d o 1-6 points of
damage, just as you do. But sometimes
they do more or less than ld6. Each time
you encounter a monster, the information you need will be given in a box, like
this:
GOBLIN: 17
You: 12

above). If the goblin’s new total is zero or
less, the creature is dead. If the goblin
still has any hit points left, it swings at
you:
If you roll a 17 or higher for the
goblin’s attack, he hits you, for 1-6 points
of damage as noted in the box above.
You roll the six-sided die and subtract
the result from your 8 hit points.

D: Id6
hp: 4

T h e number after the monster’s name is
the roll it needs to hit your fighter. “D” is
the dice to roll after the monster hits, to
find the amount of damage .it did to you.
The monster’s hit points are also given.
In this example, if you roll a 12 or
higher, you hit the goblin. You then roll
ld6, the standard amount, and add 2
(for your Strength bonus). You subtract
that total from the goblin’s 4 h p (as given

If your character is slain by the monsters, that is the end of the adventure.
But it’s not the end of the game! You can
start the fighter over again, pretending
that it is a new character.
If you play this adventure a second
time, do not keep any treasure found
before you “got killed!” You should start
the character over again, from the beginning.
Remember that you are carrying a
magical Potion of Healing. If you get
hurt, you can drink it, and it will cure
all your damage. You can then
change your hit points back to 8. You
can only drink it once, and then it’s
gone.
You may drink the potion whenever you wish, but you should wait
until you have only 2 or 3 hit points
left, if possible. If you drink it in the
middle of a battle, you must skip your
attack (you are drinking, not swinging), and roll only for the monster’s
attack for that round of combat.
14

THINGS TO REMEMBER
Keep a record of the monsters
killed and treasure found, using a
separate piece of paper.
Use the Combat Checklist whenever you have a battle.
Roll l d 6 each time you hit, to find
the amount of damage done.
Drink your potion when you are
badly hurt.

Mapping
This time, you will make a map of the
dungeon so you don’t get lost. Maps also
help in remembering where the worst
monsters were - like the ghouls - so
you can avoid them until you feel ready
for them.
You will draw your map on a piece of
graph paper. Each line one square long
will equal 10 feet in the dungeon. Copy
each map carefully. Draw an arrow
pointing to the top of the paper and
label it “North”, then draw a line across
the arrow and label “East, South, andWest.” This will help you remember the
directions.
As you draw your maps be sure to
write notes on it to help you remind you
where things are.
If you don’t make a map as you go,
you will probably get confused.

Solo adventure
Part 3: Into The Caves
Since you explored some of the caves
earlier, you find yet another entrance to
venture into this time. After finding a
suitable cave, you pause to be sure you
are ready.
T h e caves are dark and dreary, as you
remember from the last time, so you get
out your lantern and light the wick,
using your tinderbox. Then, carefully,
you step into the first “room.”
Tear the sheet of graph paper out of
the center of this booklet. Then, starting
near the bottom, copy Entry 1 Map:

1 T h e room you are in is fifty feet
square, with 10’ wide exits in the middle
of the north, south, east, and west walls.
The ceiling of the room is 15’ up, but the
corridors are only 10’ tall.
T h e walls, floor, and ceiling are made
of rough rock. There are some cracks
and crevices in the rock walls, all very
small. Standing in the exact center of the
room is a stone statue of a woman in
armor. You examine it carefully, and
finally even touch it - but it is merely a
statue, nothing magical or special.
You have entered this 50’ square
room by the southern corridor, which
leads out to fresh air and sunlight. T h e
other corridors are dark. T h e light from
your lamp helps, but shadows linger in
the corners of this large room. Do you
want to:
Stop and Listen?
Search the room?
Go down a corridor?

11 You quietly approach the room, and
you don’t see anything unusual. But as
you step into the room, some giant rats
leap out from the corner to your right,
and attack! Two of them hit you, for a
total of 3 points of damage. You are
suddenly in battle, and cannot escape.
Read 83.

13 You kill the two skeletons! As each
one “dies,” its bones collapse in a heap,
and the rusty sword drops to the floor
with a clang.
You search the area, but find no treasure. However, there is a door in the east
wall of the room. Do you want to:
Go South?
Open the door?

14 You go west, and come to another
room. It has an exit south, leading outside, and another corridor heading west.
You don’t want to go west, the ghouls
are in that direction.
You recognize this room as the entrance for your very first adventure!
This is where you hit the goblin, and he
ran away. Do you want to:
Go back East?
Go South?

any good. It attacks, and gets one free
swing while you are talking! Read 86,

you have no more metal, the creature
turns away from you, not interested any
more. You can see, now, that it has no
teeth or claws, and can’t actually hurt
you!
You watch as it ambles over to one of
the piles of rust, and it starts to eat,
ignoring you completely.
Keeping a careful eye on the creature,
you look around the room. There are

80 You put the key in the lock and turn
until you hear it “click.” Putting the key
away you open the door.
T h e r e is a small room behind the
door! T h e area looks like Entry 80A
Map (add it to your map):
T h e room is empty except for one
large chest by one wall. You walk over to
it, and discover that it’s made of heavy
wood with metal bands around it. It isn’t
locked (luckily), so you carefully open it.
But alas - it’s trapped. Make a saving
throw vs. Magic Wands! (You need to
roll a 13 or higher on ld20.)
This Saving Throw is used for many
things. Generally, it indicates whether
you j u m p out of the path of danger such as the beam of a magic wand. However, in this case, the danger is a blade,
mounted on the edge of the chest and
connected to a metal spring. When you
open the lid, the blade sweeps o u t
toward you.
If you made the Saving Throw, you
jump back as the blade misses you. However, if you missed the Saving Throw,
you take 4 points of damage!
If you are struck down to zero hit
points or less, you can grab your potion
- if you still have it - and drink it before you pass out. It will cure you somewhat, but only back u p to 4 hit points. If
you don’t have the potion left - sorry,
but you are dead! (Special note: In group
games, you will not be allowed to do this.
Zero hit points indicates death, with no
extra time to d o anything.)
If the trap kills you, read 90. But if
you survived the trap, continue reading.
You look in the chest and see hundreds of coins - 500 cp, 200 sp, and 200
ep. You start to close the chest and drag
it out with you. But as you close the lid,
you see a peep hole in the north wall,
about an inch across. It was blocked by
the door as you entered.

You look through, and see a short corridor that goes north 20‘ and turns left.
To the east, by the turn, is a large door
with two stout bars across it. A goblin is
standing by the door, apparently on
guard. The area looks like Entry 80B
Map.
There is a crack in the wall near this
peep hole. You suddenly realize that the
crack might be the edge of a secret door!
This treasure chest must belong to
goblins! However, you can’t open the secret door, so you drag the chest back out,
past the scattered bones of the dead skeletons and south to the main corridor.

you. Read the “Special Note” below.
Second Hit: Your Armor turns to
rust. Now the creature only needs a

Third Hit: Your sword turns to rust!
You must get out a dagger if you want

88 When you complete this adventure, you get Experience Points. First,
add up all the treasure you brought out
of the dungeon (ignore anything you
lost), and figure out how much it is all
worth, in gold pieces. (The explanation
of the Money system is on page IO.) You
will get 1 XP for each 1 gp worth of
treasure you find - in addition to getting the treasure.
After adding up the treasure, find out
how much Experience you get for slaying monsters, according to this chart:
Giant Rats
Goblins
Skeletons
Rust Monster

5 each
5 each
10 each
300

Add that total to your treasure total to
get the total number of Experience
Points awarded for this adventure. To
determine your 10% bonus, drop the
last number, and add it to the total
awarded. Then add the adjusted total
XP earned to the current XP on the back
of your character sheet, to find your new
total overall. To finish up, add the treas-

+

21

ure you found to the money you already
had.

Looking on the conversion chart, you
see that 100 cp = 1 gp; 100 sp = 10 gp.
Adding that to the gem value, your
newlv found treasure is worth a total of
611 gp.
For monsters, you get 300 XP for the
rust monster, plus l g X P for the giant
rats (5 each). That total is 315. Adding it
to the 611 for treasure, your total XP
award is 926.
To find your 10% bonus, drop the 6.
Add the bonus of 92 to the award of
926, for an adjusted total XP of 1018.
Then you add that to your current 523
XP, for a new total XP of 1541 - less
than 500 XP from 2nd Level! Lastly, you
add the actual treasure - 6 gems (worth
600 gp), 100 cp, and 100 sp - to your
treasure list.
That finishes this adventure. You may
go to the next adventure, or you may
wish to go shopping. If you want to buy
something now, read 89.

dungeon. Don’t be upset; it can happen
in any DUNGEONS & DRAGONS
game, and often does, through no fault
of yours. That is the end of this adventure.
You may start over, if you wish. To do
that, be sure not to keep any treasure you

DUNGEONS & DRAGONS” Characters
What comes next?
You have now learned most of the details needed to play a character in DUNGEONS & DRAGONS games. You may
now play more Solo Adventures, if you
like. Several Solo Adventures are sold
separately, including: adventure module
M1, Blizzard Pass and M2, Maze of the
Riddling Minotaur.
However, most of the fun of a DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game comes from
playing in a group. To play in a group, one
person must be the Dungeon Master (or
DM). The DM is the person who plays the
parts of the monsters and runs the game.
A new DM should read the first section of
the other booklet in this set, the DUNGEON MASTERS RULEBOOK, before

starting the game. It explains all the information needed, and includes a step-bystep game for everyone to enjoy while
learning. But a new DM should not try to
run a game before looking at that book.
A group game is best with 3-6 players.
Each player should know how to play. If
there is time, each person should read
through this booklet,just as you have. You
may also teach someone yourself, by explaining what you have learned, giving
them one of the simple characters in this
booklet (the Fighter, or Dwarf for example), and helping them during the game.
When you play in a group, you may
play your fighter, or you may choose any
of the other six characters included in
the center of this booklet. Before the
game, be sure to read the description of

the Character Class (pages 24-47), even
if you are still playing your fighter. Several players can all have the same fighter
character, if different names are used.
Fighters are always needed. If you have
4-6 people in the group, try to play most
of the characters given.
If you have time, read the rest of this
booklet to see what other information is
given. More details on group games are
given on pages 53-58. Some additional
rules, to add when you are familiar with
playing in a group, are explained on
pages 59-62. Don’t try to memorize
everything, but try to remember the
types of things explained. During a
game, use the Index on page 64 to locate
information you need.

Character Classes
Most D&D characters will be humans. A
human can be a Cleric, Fighter, MagicUser, or Thief. Humans are the most
widespread of all intelligent beings.
A character may also be a n o n human: a Dwarf, Elf, or Halfling. Each
of these classes is also a separate race of
beings. They are all commonly known as
“Demi-humans,” because they seem to
be partially human. T h e demi-human
races are all distantly related to the
human race.
One sample character for each of the
seven classes is included in the center of
this booklet. You may play those characters in group games, but before you do,
be sure to read the full description of the
class.
You may create a new character instead of using those in this booklet.
When you do, you will roll dice to determine Ability Scores. If the scores are
high enough, the character can be a
demi-human; otherwise, the character
must be human. T h e rules for creating
characters are given on pages 48-52.

the Prime Requisite Adjustment Table.
If the PR is below average, a penalty is
applied.
T h e Prime Requisite for each class is
given in each class description. Finding
the bonus or penalty is part of the procedure for creating new characters. You
will not need it until then.

Throw Table. Copy the numbers onto
your character sheet. Your Dungeon
Master will tell you when you need
them. To make a Saving Throw, roll
ld20. If the result is equal to or greater
than the number given your Saving
Throw is successful.

Prime Requisite
Each character class has a specialty. For
example, a fighter’s specialty is Strength;
a cleric’s is Wisdom. This specialty is
called the Prime Requisite for the class
(abbreviated “PR”).
If a character’s PR score is above average, the character gains a bonus every
time Experience Points are earned. See

Cleric
Description
A cleric is a human character who is dedicated to serving a great and worthy
cause. This cause is usually the cleric’s
Alignment; for example, a cleric may be
dedicated to spreading law and order. A
cleric has good fighting skills, and can
also learn to cast spells after gaining a
Level of Experience. A first level cleric
cannot cast any spells.
In D&D games, as in real life, people
have ethical and theological beliefs. This
game does not deal with those beliefs. All
characters are assumed to have them, and
they do not affect the game. They can be
assumed, just as eating, resting, and other
activities are assumed, and should not become part of the game.
.
A cleric’s spell powers come from the
strength of the cleric’s beliefs. T h e cleric
sits and meditates, and mystically learns
spells. These spells can then be used
during an adventure. Most clerical spells
are for curing, protection, and gathering
information. Cleric spells are different
from magic-user spells. Clerics can use
only their own type of spells.
Your cleric also can fight monsters. A
cleric can wear any type of armor, like a
fighter, and must be ready for combat at
any time. Unlike magic-users, whose
spells are often used during battles, a
cleric’s spells are usually needed after
battles (such as cures) or for general exploring (such as detecting things).
If your party has enough fighters,
your cleric should not need to fight
often. But you are equipped for fighting
if your combat skill is needed. Watch for
ways that your spells can help, whether
before, during, or after battles.

Other Details:
P r i m e Requisite: A cleric’s PR is
Wisdom. If a cleric has a Wisdom score
of 13 or more, the character gains a
bonus to Experience Points earned in
every adventure.
Hit Dice: A six-sided die (ld6) is used to
determine a cleric’s hit points. A cleric
starts with 1-6 hit points (plus Constitution bonus, if any) and gains ld6 more
hit points (plus bonus) with each Level
of Experience.
Armor: A cleric may wear any kind of
armor, and may use a shield.
Weapons: A cleric cannot use any weapon
with a sharp edge; this is forbidden by the
cleric’s beliefs. A cleric may only use a
mace, club, war hammer, or sling.

DUNGEONS 8c DRAGONS@characters (character class - human)
Special Abilities
CLERIC TURNING UNDEAD TABLE
A cleric has two Special Abilities: Turning Undead monsters and casting Cleric
Spells.

Cleric’s
Level

1. Turning Undead
A cleric has the power to force away certain monsters called the “Undead” (skeletons, zombies, ghouls, wights, and
other more powerful types). N o other
class has any special effect on the Undead. This special ability is called “Turning” the Undead monsters.
When a cleric encounters an Undead
monster, the cleric may either attack it
normally (with a weapon or spell), or try
to Turn it. T h e cleric cannot both attack
and Turn Undead in one round.
When you want your cleric to try to
Turn Undead, just tell your Dungeon
Master ‘‘I’llTurn the Undead.”
T h e Undead monsters are not automatically Turned by the cleric. When the
encounter occurs, the player must refer
to the Cleric Turning Undead Table to
find the effect the cleric has.
Using the Cleric Turning
Undead Table:
When the cleric encounters an Undead
monster, find the cleric’s Level of Experience on the left side of the chart. Then
read across to the column under the name
of the Undead monster, and apply the results immediately. If the attempt succeeds,
one or more of the Undead monsters will
retreat, but may soon return.
Explanation of Results

7, 9 or 11: Whenever a number is
given, the cleric has a chance to Turn
the Undead monsters. T h e player
rolls 2d6 (two six-sided dice). If the
total is equal to or greater than the
number given, the attempt at Turning Undead is successful. A cleric’s
chances improve as more Levels of
Experience are earned.

T: T h e attempt at Turning the Undead
automatically succeeds.
N: N o Effect. T h e cleric cannot Turn
that type of undead.

Success: If the attempt at Turning Undead succeeds, the Dungeon Master will
roll 2d6 to determine the number of Hit
Dice of Undead monsters that t u r n
away. You might not Turn all the monsters encountered, but if you succeed in
Turning, at least one will be affected. A
Turned monster will not touch the cleric
and will flee as far from him as possible.

2. Clerical Spells
When a cleric reaches the 2nd Level of
Experience (having earned 1500 XP or
more), the cleric can use spells.
Learning Spells:
To learn a spell, the cleric meditates. The
memory and details of the spells appear in
the cleric’s mind. The spells may be cast at
any time thereafter. The cleric will remember each spell until it is cast, even if it is not
used for days or weeks.
As a player, all you need to d o is
choose whatever spells you want your
character to have. This can only be done
at the start of an adventure. You may
choose any of the spells described hereafter. You may not choose any magicuser spells; they are a different type.
A 2nd Level cleric can cast one spell
per adventure. A 3rd Level cleric can
cast two spells per adventure.
In more advanced games, adventures
may la-st more than a day. In such cases,
a cleric can gain spells each morning, if
completely rested. Any and all spells
may be changed at this time, if desired.

at a target, and you must tell the DM
what the target is. T h e player does not
have to learn any special words. For example: “I’m casting a Cure Light Wounds
on Ruggin, the dwarf.”
When the cleric casts a spell, the memory of that spell is forgotten. -Imagine
that your cleric’s memory is like a blackboard. T h e knowledge of the spells appear on it, but each spell is erased as it is
cast. If your character knows two of the
same spells and casts one, the other still
remains to be used.
The character must be able to gesture
and speak normally to cast a spell. While
casting a spell, the cleric must stand and
concentrate. Spells cannot be cast while the
character is walking or running. If the
cleric is disturbed while casting a spell, the
spell will be ruined, and will still be
“erased,”just as if it had been cast.
Spells must be cast one at a time. If the
character wants to cast more than one (for
example, two Cure Light Wounds spells
just after a battle), the fastest they can be
cast is one each round.
Types of Spells:
Some spells have an instant effect. For
example, a Cure Light Wounds spell instantly cures damage. Other spells may
be different; the cleric may cast a spell to
gain special abilities for a short time, or
give those abilities to a friend. For example, a Remove Fear spell helps the recipient (the creature upon whom the spell is
cast) to resist fear caused by magical
effects or spells.

Casting Spells:

Saving Throws versus spells:

In the game, when you want your character to cast a spell, just tell your Dungeon Master. T h e DM may ask for some
details; for example, some spells are cast

Some spells only have full effect if the
victim fails a Saving Throw vs. Spells. If
a Saving Throw is allowed, it is mentioned in the spell description.

given diameter, or a square or rectangular “box” of a given size; both are measured in feet.
Spell Power:

Range: T h e character should be sure
that the target is within range before
casting the spell. If the description says
“Range: 0,” the spell may only be used
by the cleric, and cannot be cast on
others. If “Range: Touch” is given, the
spell can be placed on any creature the
cleric touches - including the cleric
himself (or herself, as the case may be).
Duration is given either in rounds (of 10
seconds each) o r turns (of 10 minutes
each). If the description says “Duration:
Permanent,” then the spell has an instant and permanent effect that does not
go away after a given duration.
Effect of the spell gives either the number of creatures o r objects affected, or
an area o r volume of space. If an area is
given, it is measured in square feet (a flat
area). If a 3-dimensional volume is affected, it is either a round “ball” with a

When a cleric reaches 4th level, more
powerful spells can be cast. These are
given in the D&D EXPERT Set. T h e
power of a spell is described in a way
similar to the power of a character.
Spells of the lowest level of power are
called “First Level” spells. T h e D&D
EXPERT Set describes spells of the Second, Third, Fourth, and Fifth level.
Sixth and Seventh level spells are described in the D&D COMPANION Set.

Cure Light Wounds”
Range: Touch
Duration: Permanent
Effect: Any one living creature
This spell will either heal damage or
remove paralysis. If used to heal, it will
cure 2-7 ( l d 6 + 1) points of damage. It
will not heal any damage if used to cure
paralysis. T h e cleric may cast it on himself (or hersel0 if desired.
This spell will never increase a creature’s total hit points above the original
amount.

26

Detect Evil
Range: 120’
Duration: 6 turns
Effect: Everything within 120’
When this spell is cast, the cleric will see
evilly enchanted objects within 120’
glow. It will also cause creatures that
want to harm the cleric to glow when
they a r e within range. T h e actual
thoughts of the creatures cannot be
heard. Remember that “Chaotic” does
not automatically mean Evil, although
many Chaotic monsters have evil intentions. Traps and poison are neither good
nor evil, merely dangerous.
Detect Magic
Range: 0
Duration: 2 turns
Effect: Everything within 60‘
When this spell is cast, the cleric will see
magical objects, creatures, and places
within range glow. It will not last very
long, and should be saved until the cleric
wants to see if something found during
an adventure is, in fact, magical. For
example, a door may be held shut magically, o r a treasure found might be
enchanted; in either case, the magic
item, creature, or effect will glow when it
is within the effect.
Light
Range: 120’
Duration: 12 turns
Effect: Volume of 30‘ diameter
This spell creates a large ball of light, as
if a bright torch were lit. If the spell is
cast on an object (such as the cleric’s
weapon), the light will move with the
object. If cast at a creature’s eyes, the
creature must make a Saving Throw. If
the Saving Throw is failed, the victim
will be blinded by the light until the
duration ends. A blinded creature may
not attack.

DUNGEONS 8c DRAGONS”characters (character class - human)
Protection from Evil

Remove Fear*

Resist Cold

Range: 0
Duration: 12 turns
Effect: T h e cleric only

Range: Touch
Duration: 2 turns
Effect: Any one living creature

Range: 0
Duration: 6 turns
Effect: All creatures within 30’

This spell creates an invisible magical
barrier all around the cleric’s body (less
than an inch away). All attacks against
the cleric are penalized by - 1 to their
Hit rolls, and the cleric gains a 1 bonus
to all Saving Throws, while the spell
lasts.
In addition, “enchanted” creatures
cannot even touch the cleric! If a magic
weapon is needed to hit a creature, that
creature is called “enchanted.” However,
a creature that can be hit by a silver
weapon - a lycanthrope (were-creature), for example - is not an “enchanted” creature. Any creature which is
magically summoned or controlled (such
as a Charmed character) is also considered to be an “enchanted” creature. T h e
barrier thus completely prevents all attacks from those creatures unless they
use missile weapons.
This spell will not affect a Magic
Missile (magic-user’s) spell. If the cleric
attacks anything during the spell’s duration, the effect changes slightly. “Enchanted” creatures are then able to
touch the magic-user, but the Hit roll
and Saving Throw adjustments still apply until the spell duration ends.

When the cleric casts this spell and then
touches any living creature, the spell will
calm the creature and remove any fear.
If the creature is running away due to
magically created fear, the creature may
make another Saving Throw vs. spells,
adding a bonus to the roll equal to the
cleric’s Level of Experience, up to a
maximum bonus of + 6 . If the Saving
Throw is successful, the creature may
stop running. A roll of 1 will always fail.
This Saving Throw, with bonus, may be
made even if the fear was so powerful as
to allow no Saving Throw at first!

When this spell is cast, all creatures
within 30’ of the cleric can withstand
freezing temperatures without harm. In
addition, those affected gain a bonus of
+ 2 to all Saving Throws against cold
attacks. Furthermore, any damage from
cold is reduced by - 1 per die of damage
(but with a minimum of 1 point of
damage per die). T h e effect will move
with the cleric.

+

Purify Food and Water
Range: 10’
Duration: Permanent
Effect: See below
This spell will make spoiled or poisoned
food and water safe and usable. It will
purify one ration of food (either Iron or
Standard rations), or 6 waterskins of
water, or enough normal food to feed a
dozen people. I f cast at mud, the spell
will cause the dirt to settle, leaving a pool
of pure, clear water. T h e spell will not
affect any living creature.

DUNGEONS 8c DRAGONS” characters (character class - human)
Fighter
Description
A fighter is a human who studies combat. Fighters usually have greater
Strength than other characters. They
usually hit monsters more often, and
inflict more damage.
In the D&D game, fighters protect the
weaker characters. A party of all fighters
would probably survive most dungeons,
even where magic would be useful.
Every group of explorers should have at
least one or two fighters.
Strength is needed in many game
situations. For example, a door may be
stuck, or a huge boulder may block the
party’s progress; a strong fighter can
often solve these problems. Magic might
also work, but magic is limited, and a
fighter can use strength as often as
needed.
Your fighter could probably survive a
dungeon adventure when exploring
alone. This is why your Solo Adventures
have been designed for fighters. T h e
other classes are not as self-sufficient as
the fighter. Magic-users and thieves are
much weaker, and although clerics can
wear any type of armor, they are limited
in other ways.
In group adventures, your fighter
should stay in front. If there are three or
more fighters in the party, one should
stay in the back, in case a monster tries to
sneak u p on you. Whenever a battle
occurs, don’t be afraid to move in; your
character is better equipped for combat
than any other type.
When a group is surprised, the monsters may damage the characters before
they have a chance to react. Fighters
have a better chance at surviving these
dangers, since they have more hit points.
A fighter character should know
more about the many weapons than
other characters. Be sure to read the
Combat section, on page 59, to learn
how to use both hand-to-hand and missile weapons. Learn the forms of Defensive Movement described in the same
section, so you can play your fighter
most effectively when those rules are
added to your game.
Fighters often look for magical healing potions, since they are usually hurt
in battles. Magical weapons are also valuable, adding bonuses to Hit and Damage
Rolls.

Strength. If a fighter has a Strength
score of 13 or more, the character gains
a bonus to Experience Points earned in

A fighter starts with 1-8 hit points (plus
Constitution bonus, if any) and gains
ld8 more hit points (plus bonus) with
each Level of Experience.
Armor: A fighter may wear any kind of
armor, and may use a shield.
Weapons: A fighter may use any kind of
weapon.

Special Abilities:
Fighters need no special abilities to survive and prosper. Their great strength,
hit points, strong armor and many
weapons make them a powerful character class.

One sample of each character class is
provided here for your convenience.
You may use these characters in group
adventures, but not in the Solo Adventure in this booklet.

To start one of these characters, copy

DUNGEONS 8c DRAGONS’ characters (character class - human)
Magic-user
Description
A magic-.user is a human character who
studies the powers of magic. Magic-users
find spells, put them into books, and
study those books to learn the spells.
Magic-users have their own spells, entirely different from cleric spells. A
magic-user has poor fighting skills, and
should avoid combat.
In D&D games, magic is merely a part
of the action of the game. T h e player
can imagine how spells would be cast,
using various mysterious items, but no
special items are needed by the player.
After the player has learned the effect
each spell has in the game, a magic-user
is as easy to play as any other character
class.
A magic-user concentrates on learning and casting magic spells. A high
Intelligence is needed, and the other
Ability Scores are often low. However, a
high Constitution score will help your
magic-user survive longer, because it
gives a bonus to hit points - a magicuser’s weak point.
Magic-users greatly fear damage. All
the other character classes can use armor of some kind, but magic-users can
only wear their robes or normal clothes.
Thus, they are easy to hit. In addition,
they have few hit points. Magic-users
start as the weakest characters, but can
become the most powerful! Their magic
spells can be used for many things from simple things like opening doors
and locks, to impressive and dangerous
magical attacks, such as lightning bolts
(described in the D&D EXPERT Set).

Your Magic-user should never explore
dungeons alone; one surprise could kill
you. In groups, you should always stay
in the middle of the party, protected
from attacks. Watch for ways that you
can help the battles, by casting spells, but
never try to fight a monster hand-tohand. Always carry a dagger, to be ready
if you are forced to fight. Be sure to call
for help if you get into a battle; other
characters can fight the same monster,
distracting it and (hopefully) keeping it
from attacking you.
Beware of other magic-users! Some
spells are designed specially to protect
you from attacks, including other magic.
When you encounter another magicuser, keep watch. If the enemy starts
casting a spell, warn your friends.
As a player, you should study the spell
descriptions on the next pages. Your
greatest challenge will be keeping the
character alive, to gain more Levels of
Experience.
Explanation of Magic-User
Experience Table:

Title: A magic-user should use this title
when talking with other characters. Instead of saying “I’m Felonius, a Second
Level magic-user,” the character should
say “I’m Felonius, the Seer.”
Spells: The number of spells a magicuser can cast, and their levels of power,
are given here. Spells are explained in
detail below, under “Special Abilities.”

Hit Dice: A four-sided die (ld4) is used
to determine a magic-user’s hit points. A
magic-user starts with 1-4 hit points (plus
Constitution bonus, if any) and gains
ld4 more hit points (plus bonus) with
each Level of Experience.
Armor: A magic-user may not wear any
kind of armor, and may not use a shield.
Weapons: A magic-user can only use a
dagger for a weapon.

Special Abilities
A magic-user can cast magic spells, as
described hereafter.

There are many spells for magic-users to
use. T h e power of a spell is described in
a way similar to the power of a character.
Spells of the lowest level of power are
called “First Level” spells, which can be
used by beginning magic-users. Higher
level spells are usable by higher level
characters. Be careful not to confuse
your character’s Level of Experience
with the level of a spell’s power.

DUNGEONS 8c DRAGONS” characters (character class - human)
Spell Books:
Your Medium (1st Level magic-user)
starts with a spell book, containing two
First Level spells. Your Dungeon Master
will tell you what spells your character
starts with. T h e spell book is a large
bulky thing, and cannot be easily carried. A spell book is about 2 feet square,
2-6 inches thick, and weighs at least 20
pounds. It will not fit inside a normal
sack of any size, but may be carried in a
backpack or saddlebag.
When your character becomes a Seer,
you will add another First Level spell to
the book; again, your DM will tell you
which spell. Upon reaching 3rd Level of
Experience, a Second Level spell will be
gained. When the 4th Level of Experience is reached, another Second Level
spell is added to the book. (Magic-users
of levels 4-14 are explained in the D&D
EXPERT Set.)
Assume that your character is given
these additional spells by a teacher, a
powerful magic-user of 7th Level or
greater. All magic-users of less than that
level must have teachers. These teachers
never go on adventures with characters.
They will not affect most games.
Different magic-users often have different spells in their books. For example,
you might start with the Read Magic
and Sleep spells, and find another
magic-user who knows Read Magic and
Magic Missile. But magic-users never
trade spells, nor d o they ever allow
anyone (except their teachers) to read
their spell books. T h e risk of losing the
book or having it damaged, is too great.
If a magic-user’s book is lost, the character cannot memorize any spells to cast!
One magical treasure which may be
found during an adventure is a magic
scroll. Some scrolls contain magic-user
spells. If a new spell is found on a scroll, it
may be added to the magic-user’s book but this can only be done once for each
scroll spell, and uses up the scroll in the
process. If the spell is of too high a level to
be cast, it cannot be put into the book.

also be carried during adventures, to be
cast as needed. Any magic-user can cast
a spell found on a scroll as if it were
memorized, regardless of the level of the
spell. If the spell is cast, it disappears
from the scroll.
You, the player, need only keep a list
of which of the many spells are in your
character’s book. Keep the list on your
character sheet, under “Special Abilities.” Scrolls are magic items, listed on
the back of the character sheet.

ine that the magic-user’s memory is like
a blackboard. When studying, the character “writes spells on the blackboard,”
but each spell is “erased” as it is cast. If
your character has studied a spell twice
and casts one, the other still remains to
be used.

Learning Spells:
To learn a spell, the magic-user must be
completely rested. A good night’s sleep
is enough. T h e character then gets out
the spell book and studies the spells to be
used, which takes an hour or less. T h e
character is then ready for adventure,
and is able to cast the spell or spells
studied.
A Medium can cast one spell per adventure. A Seer can cast two First Level
spells per adventure. A Conjurer can
cast 3 spells per adventure, two of the
First Level of Power and one of the
Second Level.
In more advanced games, adventures
may last more than a day. In such cases,
a magic-user can study spells each morning, if completely rested. A mule should
be brought along on long adventures, to
carry the spell book along with normal
equipment. But beware! If the book is
lost, the character is in big trouble. If
that happens, ask your Dungeon Master
what you should do.
Don’t confuse the spells memorized
with spells in a book! Your magic-user
character will eventually have many
spells in a spell book, but can still only
memorize a few each day.

T h e character must be able to gesture
and speak without interruption to cast a
spell. While casting a spell, the magicuser must concentrate, and may not
move. A spell cannot be cast while the
character is walking or running. If the
magic-user is disturbed while casting a
spell, the spell will be ruined, and will
still be “erased,” just as if it had been
cast.
Types of Spells:
Most spells have an effect that lasts for a
given time. For example, a Magic Missile
spell creates a glowing arrow that follows
the magic-user around, either until it is
shot or until a turn passes (10 minutes).
However, some higher level spells may
have “instant” duration. A Fire Ball spell
creates a n explosion which causes
damage. T h e damage remains until
cured, but the spell itself only lasts part
of a second, much less than a round.

Casting Spells:
In the game, when you want your character to cast a spell, just tell your Dungeon Master.

Saving throws vs. Spells:

Many spells only have full effect if the
victim fails a Saving Throw (vs. spells). If
a Saving Throw is allowed, it is mentioned in the spell description.

DUNGEONS 8c DRAGONS@characters (character class - human)
Magic-user Spells:
Each spell has a given Range, Duration,
and Effect.
Range: T h e character should be sure,
before casting the spell, that the target is
within range. If the description says
“Range: 0,” the spell may only be used
by the magic-user, and cannot be cast on
others. If “Range: Touch” is given, the
spell can be placed on any creature the
magic-user touches - including the
magic-user himself (or herself, as the
case may be).
Duration is given either in rounds (of 10
seconds each) or turns (of 10 minutes
each). If the description says “Duration:
Permanent,” then the spell has an instant and permanent effect that does not
go away after a given duration.
Effect of the spell gives either the number of creatures o r objects affected, o r
an area o r volume of space. If an area is
given, it is measured in square feet (a flat
area). If a 3-dimensional volume is affected, it is either a round “ball” with a
given diameter, o r a square o r rectangular “box” of a given size; both are measured in feet.

Spells. If the Saving Throw is successful,
the spell has no effect. If it is failed, the
victim will believe that the magic-user is
its “best friend,” and will try to defend
the magic-user against any threat,
whether real or imagined. T h e victim is
“Charmed.”
As a general rule, the “persons” affected by this spell are all creatures
which look similar to humans in various
ways. It will not affect animals, magical
creatures (such as living statues), o r
human-like creatures larger than ogres.
You will learn, through trial and error,
which monsters can be charmed.
If the magic-user can speak a language that the Charmed victim understands, the magic-user may give orders
to the victim. These orders should
sound like suggestions, as if ‘ ) u t between friends.” These orders will usually
be obeyed, but orders that are contrary
to the victim’s nature (alignment and
habits) may be resisted. A victim will
refuse to obey if ordered to kill itself.

Floating Disc
Range: 0
Duration: 6 turns
Effect: Disc remains within 6’
This spell creates an invisible magical
horizontal platform about the size and
shape of a small round shield. It can
carry u p to 5000 cn (500 pounds). It
cannot be created in a place occupied by
a creature o r object. T h e floating disc is
created at the height of the magic-user’s
waist, and will always remain at that
height. It will automatically follow the
magic-user, remaining within 6’ at all
times. It can never be used as a weapon,
because it has no solid existence and
moves slowly. When the duration ends,
the floating disc will disappear, suddenly
dropping anything upon it.
Hold Portal

Magical Spell Descriptions
FIRST LEVEL MAGIC-USER SPELLS

after casting this spell, a magic-user
walks into a room containing a door
locked by magic, a magical potion laying
nearby, and a treasure chest containing a
magic wand. All the magic will glow, but
only the door and potion will be seen;
the light of the glowing wand is hidden
by the treasure chest.

A Charm may last for months. T h e
victim may make another Saving Throw
every day, week, or month, depending
on its Intelligence. If you are Charmed,
your DM will tell you when to make the
new Saving Throw.
T h e Charm is automatically broken if
t h e magic-user attacks t h e victim,
whether by spell or by weapon. T h e
victim will fight normally if attacked by
the magic-user’s allies.
Detect Magic
Range: 0
Duration: 2 turns
Effect: Everything within 60’
When this spell is cast, the magic-user
will see all magical objects, creatures,
and places within range glow. This effect
will not last very long, and should be
saved until the magic-user wants to see if
something found during an adventure
is, in fact, magical. Example: Shortly
39

Range: 10’
Duration: 2-12 (2d6) turns
Effect: One door, gate, o r similar
portal
This spell will magically hold shut any
“portal” - for example, a door o r gate.
A Knock spell will open the Hold Portal. Any creature 3 or more hit dice
greater than the caster (including characters) may break open a held portal in
one round’s time, but the portal will
relock if allowed to close within the
duration of the spell.

cast on an object (such as a coin), the
light will move with the object. If cast at
a creature’s eyes, the creature must
make a Saving Throw. If the Saving
Throw is failed, the victim will be
blinded by the light until the duration
ends. A blinded creature may not attack.
If the Saving Throw is successful, the
Light appears in the air behind the
intended victim.
Magic Missile
Range: 150’
Duration: 1 round
Effect: Creates 1 or more arrows

A Magic Missile is a glowing arrow,
created and shot by magic, which inflicts
2-7 ( l d 6 + 1) points of damage to any
creature it strikes. After the spell is cast,
the arrow appears next to the magicuser and hovers there until the magicuser causes it to shoot. When shot, it will
automatically hit any visible target. It will
move with the magic-user until shot or
until the duration ends. T h e Magic Missile actually has no solid form, and
cannot be touched. A Magic Missile
never misses its target and the target is
not allowed a Saving Throw.
For every 5 levels of experience of the
caster, two more missiles are created by
the same spell. Thus a 6th Level Magicuser may create three missiles. T h e missiles may be shot at different targets.
Protection from Evil
Range: 0
Duration: 6 turns
Effect: T h e magic-user only
This spell creates an invisible magical
barrier all around the magic-user’s body
(less than an inch away). All attacks
against the magic-user are penalized by
- 1 to their Hit rolls, and the magic-user
gains a 1 bonus to all Saving Throws,
while the spell lasts.
In addition, “enchanted” creatures
cannot even touch the magic-user! If a

+

magic weapon is needed to hit a creature, that creature is called “enchanted.”
However, a creature that can be hit by a
silver weapon - a lycanthrope (werecreature), for example - is not an “enchanted” creature. T h e barrier thus
completely prevents all from attacks
from those creatures unless they use
missile weapons.
This spell will not affect a Magic Missile spell. If the Magic-user attacks anything during the spell’s duration, the
effect changes slightly. “Enchanted”
creatures are then able to touch the
magic-user, but the Hit roll and Saving
Throw adjustments still apply until the
spell duration ends.
Read Languages
Range: 0
Duration: 2 turns
Effect: T h e magic-user only
This spell will allow the magic-user to
read, not speak, any unknown languages
or codes, including treasure maps, secret
symbols, and so forth, until the duration
ends.

If a Magic.Missile is shot at a magicuser protected by this spell, the magicuser may make a Saving Throw VS.
Spells (one Saving Throw per missile). If
successful, the Magic Missile will have
no effect.
Sleep
Range: 240‘
Duration: 4-16 (4d4) turns
Effect: 2-16 Hit Dice of living creatures
within a 40’ square area
This spell will put creatures to sleep for
up to 16 turns. It will only affect creatures with 4 1 Hit Dice or less - generally, small or man-sized creatures. All the
creatures to be affected must be within a
40’ x 40’ area. T h e spell will not work
against Undead or very large creatures,
such as dragons. Any sleeping creature
can be awakened by force (such as a slap
or kick). A sleeping creature may be
killed with a single blow of any edged
weapon, regardless of its hit points.
Your Dungeon Master will roll to find
the total Hit Dice of monsters affected,
using 2d8. T h e victims get no Saving
Throw.

+

Read Magic
Range: 0
Duration: 1 turn
Effect: T h e magic-user only
This spell will allow the magic-user to
read, not speak, any magical words or
runes, such as those found on magic
scrolls and other items. Unfamiliar
magic writings cannot be understood
without using this spell. However, once a
magic-user reads a scroll or runes with
this spell, that magic can be read or
spoken later (without) using a spell. All
spell books are written in magical words,
and only their owners may read them
without using this spell.
Shield

Ventriloquism

Range: 0
Duration: 2 turns
Effect: T h e magic-user only
This spell creates a magical barrier all
around the magic-user (less than an inch
away). It moves with the magic-user.
While the duration lasts, the magic-user
becomes Armor Class 2 against missiles,
and AC 4 against all other attacks.
40

Range: 60’
Duration: 2 turns
Effect: One item or location
This spell will allow the magic-user to
make the sound of his or her voice to
come from somewhere else, such as a
statue, animal, dark corner, and so forth.

DUNGEONS 8c DRAGONS@characters (character class - human)
Continual Light
Range: 120‘
Duration: Permanent
Effect: Volume of 60’ diameter
This spell creates a globe of light 60‘
across. It is much brighter than a torch,
but not as bright as full daylight. It will
continue to glow forever, o r until magically removed. It may be cast on an
object,just as the first level light spell. If
cast at a creature’s eyes, the victim must
make a Saving Throw vs. S,pells. If the
Saving Throw is failed, the victim is
blinded. If the Saving Throw is successful, the globe will still appear, but will
remain in the place it was cast, and the
intended victim will suffer no ill effects.
Detect Evil
Range: 60‘
Duration: 2 turns
Effect: Everything within 60’
When this spell is cast, the magic-user
will see all evilly enchanted objects
within 60’ glow. It will also cause creatures that want to harm the magic-user
to glow when they are within range. T h e
actual thoughts of the creatures cannot
be heard. Remember that “Chaotic”
does not automatically mean Evil, although many Chaotic monsters have evil
intentions. Traps and poison are neither
good nor evil, merely dangerous.
Invisibility
Range: 240‘
Duration: Permanent until broken
Effect: One creature o r object
This spell will make any one creature o r
object invisible. When a creature becomes invisible, all items carried and
worn also become invisible. Any invisible
item becomes visible again when it leaves
the creature’s possession (dropped, set
down, etc.). If the magic-user makes an
object invisible that is not being carried
or worn, it will become visible again
when touched by any living creature. An
invisible creature will remain invisible
until he or she attacks o r casts any spell.
A light source (such as a torch) may be
made invisible, but the light given off
will always remain visible.

Range: 60’

Effect: All thoughts in one direction
This spell will allow the magic-user to
“hear” thoughts. T h e magic-user must
concentrate in one direction for six
rounds (1 minute) to ESP the thoughts
of a creature within range (if any). Any
single living creature’s thoughts may be
understood, regardless of the language.
T h e thoughts (if any) of Undead creatures cannot be “heard” with this spell.
If more than one creature is within
range and in the direction concentrated
on, the magic-user will “hear” a confused jumble of thoughts. T h e magicuser may only sort out the jumble by
concentrating for an extra six rounds to
find a single creature. T h e ESP will not
be hampered by any amount of wood or
liquid, and will penetrate as much as 2
feet of rock, but a thin coating of lead
will block the spell.
Detect Invisible
Range: 10‘ per Level of the Magic-user
Duration: 6 turns
Effect: T h e magic-user only
When this spell is cast, the magic-user
can see all invisible creatures and objects
within range. T h e range is 10’ for each
level of the magic-user. For example, a
Conjurer can use this spell to see invisible things within 30’.

41

Knock
Range: 60’
Duration: See below
Effect: One lock or bar
This spell will open any type of lock.
Any normal o r magically locked door
(by a Hold Portal o r Wizard Lock spell),
and any secret door, may be opened
when found (but a secret door must be
found before it can be Knocked open).
Any locking magic will remain, however,
and will take affect once again when the
door is closed. This spell will also cause a
gate to open, even if stuck, and will
cause any treasure chest to open easily. It
will also cause a barred door to open,
magically forcing the bar to fall to the
floor. If a door is locked and barred, both
will be opened.
Levitate
Range: 0
Duration: 6 turns + 1 turn per Level of
the magic-user
Effect: T h e magic-user only
When this spell is cast, the magic-user
may move u p or down in the air without
any support. This spell does not, however, allow the magic-user to move from
side to side. For example, a magic-user
could levitate to a ceiling, and then could
move sideways by pushing and pulling.
Motion u p o r down is at the rate of 20‘
per round. T h e spell cannot be cast on
another person or object. T h e magicuser may carry a normal amount of
weight while levitating, possibly another
man-sized creature if not in metal armor. Any creature smaller than man-size
can be carried, unless similarly heavily
laden.

Locate Object

+

Range: 60’
10‘ per Level of the
magic-user
Duration: 2 turns
Effect: One object within range
For this spell to be effective in finding an
object, the magic-user must know exactly what the object looks like. A common type of object, such as a flight of
stairs, can also be detected by this spell.
T h e spell will point to the nearest desired object within range, giving the
direction but not the distance. T h e range
increases as the magic-user gains Levels
of experience. For example, a Seer can
locate objects u p to 80’ away; a Conjurer,
u p to 90‘.
Mirror Image
Range: 0
Duration: 6 turns
Effect: T h e magic-user only
With this spell, the magic-user creates
1-4 (ld4) additional images which look
and act exactly the same as the magicuser. T h e images appear and remain
next to the magic-user, moving if the
magic-user moves, talking if the magicuser talks, and so forth. T h e magic-

user need not concentrate; the images
will remain until the duration ends, or
until hit. T h e images are not real, and
cannot actually d o anything. Any successful attack on the magic-user will
strike an image instead, which will
merely cause that image to disappear
(regardless of the actual damage).

Saving Throw, the concentration is broken and the phantasm disappears.
This spell never inflicts any real
damage! Those “killed” by it will merely
fall unconscious, those “turned to stone”
will be paralyzed, and so forth. T h e
effects wear off in 1-4 (ld4) turns.

Phantasmal Force

Web

Range: 240’
Duration: Concentration (see below)
Effect: A volume 2O’x2O’x20‘

Range: 10’
Duration: 48 turns
Effect: A volume 10’ x 10‘ x 10’

This spell creates o r changes a p pearances within the area affected. T h e
magic-user should create the illusion of
something he or she has seen. If not, the
DM will give a bonus to Saving Throws
against the spell’s effects. If the magicuser does not use this spell to attack, the
illusion will disappear when touched. If
the spell is used to “create” a monster, it
will be AC 9 and will disappear when hit.
If the spell is used as an attack (a phantasmal magic missile, collapsing wall,
etc.), the victim may make a Saving
Throw vs. Spells; if successful, the victim
is not affected, and realizes that the
attack is an illusion. T h e phantasmal
force will remain as long as the magicuser concentrates. If the magic-user

This spell creates a mass of sticky strands
which are difficult to destroy except with
flame. It usually blocks the area affected.
Giants and other creatures with great
strength can break through a web in 2
rounds. A human of average Strength (a
score of 9-12) will take 2-8 (2d4) turns to
break through the web. Flames (from a
torch, for example) will destroy the web
in 2 rounds, but all creatures within the
web will be burned for 1-6 (ld6) points
of damage. Anyone wearing Gauntlets
of Ogre Power (a magical treasure) can
break free of a web in 4 rounds.
Wizard Lock
Range: 10’
Duration: Permanent
Effect: One portal o r lock
This spell is a more powerful version of
a Hold Portal spell. It will work on any
lock, not merely doors, and will last
forever (or until magically dispelled).
However, a Knock spell can be used to
open the Wizard Lock. A wizard locked
door may be opened easily by the magicuser casting the Wizard Lock, and also
by any magic-using character o r creature of 3 o r more Levels (or Hit Dice)
greater than the caster. Any such opening does not remove the magic, and the
lock will relock when allowed to close
(just as the Hold Portal spell).

Thief
Description
A thief is a human who specializes in
stealth, lockpicking, trap removing, and
other activities. Thieves are the only
characters that can open locks and find
traps without using magic. As the name
indicates, however, thieves d o steal,
though rarely from members of their
own groups. Any thief who steals from
friends is usually not permitted to adventure with them ever again!
In the D&D game, all thieves belong to
an organization (sometimes called a
Guild). Every town has a building, called
the Guild Hall, where thieves may live and
eat (for a price, of course). Every thief
learns “The Arts” (a thief‘s unique skills;
see Special Abilities, below) from teachers
at the Guild. Thieves are a normal part of
D&D life, because of their unique skills,
but they are not usually welcome in the
better parts of towns.
While adventuring, your thief should
avoid danger whenever possible. T h e
thief’s job is to use the Special Abilities
where needed. A thief’s skills can be
very useful, as they can be used over and
over. For example, a magic-user may use
a spell to open a lock, but the spell only
works once; a thief may try to open locks
whenever desired.
When an encounter occurs, your thief
should stay out of the way. You may try to
sneak around a mons’ter, either to steal its
treasure or to attack it from behind. You
should not fight hand-to-hand unless you
have to. A thief has few hit points, and
although some light armor may be worn,
it is not much protection.

Most thieves have high Dexterity
scores. Since this can affect missile fire
(see Advanced Combat, page 58), you
should learn the rules for missiles, and
carry missile weapons. A sword or dagger will be needed in situations where
you can’t avoid close combat.
Thieves are found in most groups of
adventurers. T h e task of staying alive by
sneaking and using your wits, instead of
just fighting, can be an exciting game
challenge.
Explanation of Thief
Experience Table:
XP: When this number of Experience
Points have been earned, the thief automatically moves u p to the next Level of
Experience.
Title: Your thief should use this title
when talking with other characters. Instead of saying “I’m Greegan, a Second

“I’m Greegan, the Footpad.”
Other Details:
Prime Requisite: A thief’s PR is Dexterity. If a thief has a Dexterity score of
13 or more, the character gains a bonus
to Experience Points earned in every
adventure.
Hit Dice: A four-sided die (ld4) is used
to determine a thief’s hit points. A thief
starts with 1-4 hit points (plus Constitution bonus, if any) and gains ld4 more
hit points (plus bonus) with each Level
of Experience.

Armor: A thief may only wear Leather

Weapons: A thief may use any missile
weapon, and any other weapon usable
with one hand (two-handed weapons are
prohibited. For more information, see
“Advanced Combat,” page 58).

DUNGEONS 8c DRAGONS@characters (character class - human)
Special Abilities:
Thieves know how to Open Locks, Find
and Remove Traps, Climb Walls, Move
Silently, Hide in Shadows, Pick Pockets,
and Hear Noise. They also learn the skill
of “Backstabbing.”
Except for “Hear Noise,” each number is
the Percentage chance that the thief is
successful in using that Special Ability.
Your Dungeon Master will roll d % ; if the
result is equal to or less than the Percentage given, the thief’s attempt is successful. “Hear Noise” is determined in a
similar way, using ld6.
Explanation of Thief Special Abilities:
OPEN LOCKS may only be tried once
per lock, and only if “Thieves’ Tools” are
carried. T h e thief may not try again’with
that lock until gaining another Level of
Experience.

MOVE SILENTLY will always seem successful to the thief. However, the DM
will know (based on the Percentage roll)
whether the thief’s movement is actually
heard by nearby enemies, who may then
take appropriate action.
HIDE IN SHADOWS means that the
thief moves into and remains in shadows, also using neutral concealment.
Movement is possible while hiding, but
not attacking. T h e attempt will always
seem successful to the thief, but only the
DM will know for sure.
PICK POCKETS may be risky. If the
DM rolls a number greater than twice
the given chance for success, the thief is
not only seen by those nearby, but is
caught in the act by the intended victim,
who may (and often does) react unfavorably.

one works. T h e attempt will automatically fail if improperly used. For Example: An ogre is charging at the party, so
you say “My thief will Hide in Shadows
and get out a dagger.” T h e DM replies,
“The ogre sees the movement, and
heads straight for your thief!”
Backstabbing: If a thief can sneak up on a
victim, completely unnoticed, the thief
may Backstab. If the intended victim sees,
hears, or is otherwise warned of the thief‘s
approach, a Backstab may not be taken,
but the thief may still attack normally.
When Backstabbing, the thief gains a
bonus of 4 on the Hit Roll, and if the
target is hit, the damage done is twice
normal.

+

FIND TRAPS may also be tried only
once per trap. If a trap is found, the
thief may attempt to remove it.
REMOVE TRAPS may only be tried if a
trap is found. It may be tried only once
per trap.
CLIMB WALLS applies to any steep
surfaces, such as sheer cliffs, walls, and
so forth. T h e chances for success are
good, but if failed, the thief slips at the
halfway point and falls. T h e DM will roll
for success only once for every 100’
climbed. If failed, the thief takes 1-6
(ld6) points of damage per 10’ fallen.
Failure during a 10’ climb will inflict 1
point of damage.
~

HEAR NOISE (checked using 1d6) applies both to listening at doors and hearing the footsteps of approaching monsters. However, there is too much noise
during battles to hear anything unusual.

Elf

Other Details:

Description

Prime Requisite: Elves have two Prime
Requisites: Strength and Intelligence. If
an elf has a score of 13 or more in both
Ability Scores, the character gains a 5%
bonus to Experience Points earned in
every adventure. If the Intelligence
score is 16 or greater (along with
Strength of 13 or more), the XP bonus is
10%.

An elf is slender and graceful, with
delicate features and pointed ears. An
elf is 5 to 5v2 feet tall, and weighs about
120 pounds. Elves are able to use all
armor and weapons, and can cast magicuser spells. They can thus be valuable
friends (or dangerous opponents), but
usually prefer to spend their time feasting and frolicking in woodland glades.
They rarely visit the cities of Man. Elves
are fascinated by magic and never grow
tired of collecting spells and magic items,
especially if the items are beautifully
crafted. An elf character must start with
an Intelligence score of 9 or greater.
Elves are similar to both fighters and
magic-users. Read the description of the
fighter class for some tips on playing a
fighter-type character, but remember
that your elf does not have as many hit
points as a fighter. Be sure your character is either undamaged or only slightly
hurt before you enter a battle; otherwise, stay back and help with magic
spells, as a magic-user does.
Explanation of Elf Experience Table:
XP: When this number of Experience
Points have been earned, the elf automatically moves up to the next Level of
Experience.
Title: Your elf should use this title when
talking with other characters. Instead of
saying “I’m Belrain, a Second Level elf,”
the character should say “I’m Belrain,
the Warrior Seer.”
Spells: T h e number of magic-user spells
an elf can cast, and their level of power,
are given here. Spells are explained below, under “Special .Abilities.”

Minimum Scores: An elf character must
have an Intelligence score of 9 or

DUNGEONS 8c DRAGONS” characters (character class - demi-human)
Halfling
Description
A halfling is a short demi-human, and
looks much like a human child with
slightly pointed ears. A halfling stands
about 3’ tall and weighs about 60
pounds. Halflings rarely have beards.
They are outgoing but not unusually
brave, seeking treasure as a way to gain
the comforts of home, which they so
dearly love. Halflings are woodland folk,
and usually get along well with elves.
They have special abilities in the outdoors. A halfling character must start
with a score of 9 or greater in both
Dexterity and Constitution.
Halflings behave similarly to fighters
and dwarves. Read the description of
the fighter class for some tips on playing
your halfling. Remember your special
abilities (see below), and use them whenever possible. A halfling’s Saving Throws
are as good as those of dwarves, and you
may survive where others fall to magic
or poison attacks.

Explanation of Halfling
Experience Table:

Other Details:
Prime Requisite: A halfling has two
Prime Requisites: Strength and Dexterity. If either of these Ability scores is 13
or greater, the character gains a 5%
bonus to Experience Points earned in
every adventure. If both of these scores
are 13 or greater, the XP bonus is 10%.

XP: When this number of Experience
Points have been earned, the halfling
automatically moves u p to the next Level
of Experience.

Minimum Scores: A halfling character
must have a score of 9 or greater in both
Dexterity and Constitution.

Title: Your halfling should use this title
when talking with other characters. Instead of saying “I’m Touchberry, a Second
Level halfling,” the character should say
“I’m Touchberry, the Warrior.”

Hit Dice: A six-sided die (ld6) is used to
determine a halfling’s hit points. A halfling starts with 1-6 hit points (plus Constitution bonus, if any) and gains ld6
more hit points (plus bonus) with each
Level of Experience.

HALFLING SAVING THROW TABLE

Armor: A halfling may wear any kind of
armor, and may use a shield. However,
their armor and shields must be specially
made for their small size. Even dwarfsized armor is too large for them.

Weapons: A halfling may use any small
sized weapon (such as a dagger, short
sword, or short bow). Halflings may not
use two-handed swords, longbows, battle
axes, pole arms, or other large weapons.

Special Abilities:
A halfling gains several combat bonuses
(some due to their small size) and can
hide easily in woodlands.

Combat: Halflings often use missile
weapons, and are better at dodging the
attacks of large creatures than are other
characters. All halflings gain the following bonuses when in combat.

- 2 bonus to Armor Class when attacked by creatures larger than
man-size;
+ 1 bonus to the Hit Roll when using
any missile (see Additional Rules,
page 59)
+ 1 bonus to Individual Initiative (optional combat rule, page 59)
Hiding: Outdoors, halflings are difficult
to spot, having the ability to seemingly
vanish into woods or underbrush. In
such cover, they can only be detected
10% of the time (the DM will roll).
Halflings can even hide in dungeons,
though not with as much success. In
normal light, if a halfling finds some
shadows or cover to hide in (remaining
absolutely quiet and not moving), the
attempt at hiding will succeed Y3 of the
time. To use this ability, tell your DM.
T h e DM will roll ld6; a result of 1 or 2
indicates success at hiding, as long as the
character does not move or make any
noise.
Magical light, such as a cleric’s Light
spell, will ruin the attempt. If the character is carrying any light, it will be impossible to hide.

DUNGEONS 8c DRAGONS@characters
Making up a new character
After you are used, to the rules of the
game by playing your Fighter, you can
try other characters by using the Character Sheets included in this booklet. But
remember that they are not usable in the
Solo Adventure! Th.at adventure was
designed only for your first fighter.
Sooner or later you will want to make
up your own new character. Before you
start, get a pencil and all the dice. You
will also need a blank Character Sheet
(or a normal-size piece of paper) to keep
track of the details.
If you are using a blank piece of
paper, copy the form of the Character
Sheet onto it - in other words, allow a
space for your name and the character’s
name at the top left, a place for Class,
Level, Armor Class, and Hit Points below that, and so forth.
Your first try at creating a new character will probably take an hour or so.
Even when you are used to the procedure, it will still take 10-30 minutes.
You should not try to create a character
after everyone gets together for a game.
All the rolling, adjusting, buying, and so
forth should be done beforehand.
Your Dungeon Master will be needed
for part of the process, and should
watch the creation of the character, including all dice rolls. You should get
together with the DM before the game
to work out the details. O n e good
method is to have all the players make
new characters together, with the Dungeon Master helping.
At the bottom of this page is a list of
the steps to take when making a new
character; each step is then explained in
detail.

Now find your highest Ability Score.
If it is less than 9, you should roll all the
Scores again. You may keep the character if you wish, but he or she probably
won’t be suitable for dangerous adventuring! However, before you discard the
character, ask your Dungeon Master
what to do. Your DM might prefer that
you play the character you rolled, especially if you are an experienced player.
If two or more Ability Scores are less
than 6, the character may have problems
later on. This type of character should
also be discarded, unless the DM says
otherwise.
You can adjust the’ Ability Scores in
step 3 (Exchange Ability Points), but first
you must decide what Class your character will be.

3. Exchange Ability Score points (if
desired)

7. Figure out your:
a. Armor Class
b. Hit Roll Chart
c. Saving Throws
8. Note adjustments for Ability

9. Give your Character a Name and
Alignment
10. Get ready to play

2. Choose a Class
Each type of character is called a Class.
Your first character’s Class was Fighter.
You know now that there are other
kinds of adventurers: clerics, magicusers, and thieves. You could play one of
those, or even a character that’s not
human: you can be a dwarf, an elf, or a
short child-sized person called a halfling.
Each of these seven adventurer types is a
Character Class.

1. Roll for Ability Scores

Instead of just making u p numbers for
your Ability Scores, you will roll dice to
find each Score. This is done by rolling
the six-sided die three times, and adding
the results. Or, if you have other sixsided dice, roll 3 dice together.
For example, if you roll 1 each time,
then the total score is 3, the least possible.
If you roll all sixes, then the total is 18, the
highest you can have. You should finish
with six numbers, each between 3 and 18,
which are your character’s Ability Scores.
Write the Scores down as you roll them,
next to the names of the Abilities.

Each Class has a specialty. Fighters are
strong, Magic-Users are intelligent, Clerics are wise, and so forth. This specialty
is called the Prime Requisite for the
Class. For example, Strength is the
Prime Requisite for Fighters.
If your character’s Prime Requisite is
high enough, you will get a bonus on
Experience Points. That is why your first
Fighter got a bonus: your Strength, the
Prime Requisite, was 17. You are allowed
to play a Fighter with.any Strength score,
but strong fighters are better at what
they d o (and get more XP) than weaker
ones.
You are not forced to pick a Class on
your highest Ability Score - but it
helps. If you have two or more high
scores, you may wish to consider a nonhuman character.
Look at the following chart, and compare your highest Ability Scores with the
Prime Requisites for the Character
Classes. Then, if you are playing a
Human character, pick one Class that
fits the Ability Scores you rolled.
(Constitution and Charisma affect all the
Classes, and are never Prime Requisites.)

out XP, you will add extra points. But if
your Prime Requisite is low, you will be
penalized, and must subtract XP from
the number awarded by the DM.
T h e amount of XP added or subtracted is given in the following chart:

3. Exchange Ability Score Points

Dwa rves, Elves, and Halflings
Any human character can be any of the
four Human classes, but non-human
char,acters are handled differently. It
you 1&h to play a non-human character,
YOU must have high Ability Scores in
certai n areas.
Elves have abilities similar to both fighters i1nd magic-users, so they must have
good Scores in both Strength and Intelligence. Both of these Ability Scores are
Prime Requisites for Elves. Also, if your
char;xcter has an 8 or less for Intelligence,
the c,haracter cannot be an Elf.
H alflings have some fighting abilities,
and must have good Strength and Dexteritiy. Both of these are Prime Requisites
for Ijalflings. In addition, Halflings are
also very healthy. If your character has
an 8 or less in Dexterity or Constitution,
the (:haracter cannot be a Halfling.
D.warves are always healthy, too. If
your. character has an 8 or less in Constitu tion, the character cannot be a dwarf.
Dwarves specialize in combat, similar to
figh ters, so their Prime Requisite is
Strength.

If you wish to play a non-human character, you may pick one of these i f you
have rolled the minimum Scores given,
or if you can exchange ability points (see
step 3) to meet the minimum Score(s)
for the Class.
Whichever Class you pick, you should
read the full description of the Class on
pages 23 - 47 before you get to step 6.
Prime Requisites
If you rolled well and chose well, the
Ability Score of your Prime Requisite
should be 9 or greater. But it can be fun to
play characters with lower scores, too.
Imagine a poor dwarf who is perfectly
healthy (Constitution 16) but very weak
(Strength 5); he does the best he can in
combat, but doesn't do much damage.
The fun in the game comes from role
playing, and this could be a very interesting character to play. Remember that you
can always start another character later.
For a very high Prime Requisite Score,
your character gets a bonus to XP (Experience Points). At the end of each adventure, when the Dungeon Master gives

Your Prime Requisite (and rnb that
score) goes up 1 point for each 2 points
that another Ability Score goes down.
Constitution and Charisma points
can never be exchanged with others.
Dexterity cannot be lowered (but it
may be raised if you have a Thief or
Halfling character).
No score can be lowered below 9. If it
is already 10 or less, it cannot be
lowered.

A Cleric with Strength and Wisdom
of 15 drops the Strength by 6 (to 9)
and raises the Wisdom by 3 (to 18).

At this point, it is possible to raise a
Prime Requisite by lowering other Ability Scores. This is like practicing hard to
learn your Class, but at the cost of not
developing another Ability at the same
time. (For example, a Magic-User might
study hard and neglect his exercise for a
higher Intelligence, and end up with a
lower Strength.)
T h e rules for exchanging Ability
Points are:

If you want to exchange any Ability
Score points, you must d o that now before you go any further in making the
character. N o exchanges can be made
later.

4. Roll for Hit Points
Different Classes have different numbers of hit points. Fighters and Dwarves
need many because they take damage in
battle. Magic-Users and Thieves have
less hit points, and should try to stay out
of fights. Other Classes are in between,
and can fight if they must, but often
avoid it if possible.
Find your character’s Class on the
chart below, and roll one die to find your
starting Hit Points.

Now find your Constitution Score on the
Bonuses and Penalties for Ability Scores
Table below, and apply the bonus or
penalty to the number of hit points you
rolled. But whatever the adjustments,
your hit points cannot be lowered to
zero; you will have at least 1 hit point for
each roll.

(This chart is used for adjustments for
most of the Ability Scores, and you will
refer to it later.)
You can immediately see the benefit of
having a good Constitution score. Your
first character, the Fighter with a Constitution of 16, had a + 2 bonus to hit
points. Therefore, your starting roll for
that character would have been a 6 (out
of 8 possible), plus a bonus of 2 , for a
total of 8 hit p0int.s. Did you ever get

badly hurt, down to 2 hit points in your
adventures? If so, you could have been
dead - but you were saved by the bonus
for your high Constitution!
Each time you gain a Level of experience, you will roll for more Hit Points.
And each time you roll, you adjust the
roll according to your Constitution
score.

5. Roll for Money
Your character starts out with no possessions except for normal clothes and a
little money, saved u p over many years.
You will need to go shopping for equipment, but first you must find out how
much money you have.
Roll 3d6 (the total of 3 rolls of a sixsided die), and multiply the total by 10.
(For example, if you roll 12, the total is
120.) This is the amount of gold pieces
that you start with. Write that on the
back of your character sheet in the
“Money” box.,
6. Buy equipment
Now you can spend your money on the
equipment you need to go adventuring.
There is a complete list of equipment in
the center of this book.
There are restrictions on what items
you are allowed to have, especially on
armor and weapons. Before you go
shopping, be sure you have read the full
description of your Character Class
(pages 39 - 47). For Example, a MagicUser cannot wear any armor at all, and
can only use a dagger for a weapon! It
would be a waste of money for this Class
to buy a sword or shield; instead, money
can be saved or spent on oil, torches, and
other items. Thieves, on the other hand,
must buy Thieves’ Tools to be able to
Open Locks.
On a piece of scrap paper, write down
all the equipment you want to buy and
add u p the cost. If it’s more than you
have, you must put something back.
When you can pay for your list of equipment, subtract the cost from your
money, and write the equipment down
on the back of the Character Sheet.
Be careful shopping! You may forget to
buy rope, for example, and suddenly find
a need for it during an adventure - and if
you didn’t buy it, you don’t have it. But
remember also that money can be saved
for buying expensive equipment later.
Only buy what you need.

7. Figure out your Armor Class, Hit
Roll chart, and Saving Throws
a. Armor Class
Armor Type
Your Armor Class is a combination of the
type of armor you are wearing, plus any
adjustments due to Dexterity. First, find
your armor type on the chart below:
ARMOR CLASS
Armor Type

Armor Class

No armor
Leather
Chain Mail
Plate Mail
Shield

7
5
3
Bonus of 1*

*If you bought a shield, subtract 1 from
your Armor Class number. For example,
Chain Mail alone is AC 5, but with a
shield it drops to AC 4.
Dexterity Adjustments to Armor Class
Find your Dexterity Score on the
Bonuses and Penalties Table and for
every + I bonus, subtract 1 from your
Armor Class and for every - 1 penalty,
add 1 to your Armor Class.

Remember: the lower the AC number,
the harder you are to hit. A minus
(Penalty) to Armor Class actually raises
the number, making you easier to hit.
If your AC is even better than zero for example, with a Dexterity Score of 18
and wearing Plate Mail and Shield then “minus” numbers are used. In this
case, the AC would be “minus one” ( - 1).

b. Hit Roll Chart
Every starting character has the same
chances to hit. You will not change the
chart until your character gets at least to
4th level. You may find magic weapons
as treasures, which help your chances to
hit as well as the damage done.
Copy the numbers below into the
boxes at the bottom of the Character
Sheet (Hit Roll Needed):
When you try to hit a monster, roll ld20.
Adjust the roll for your Strength, and
find the total on the bottom line of the
chart. You hit the Armor Class on the
chartjust above the roll. Announce what
Armor Class you hit, and the DM will tell
you whether you hit or missed your
target. For example, if your total is 15,
you say “I hit AC 4.” If the target was AC
4 or higher (AC 5, AC 6, etc.), then you
have successfully hit.
If your adjusted total is 9 or less, then
you miss, whatever the target is. If your
adjusted total is 20 or more, then you hit,
whatever the target is - as long as -it’s
possible to hit it. (There may indeed be
things you can’t hit; you will know this is
the case if your Dungeon Master says you
missed, even with a total of 20 or more.)
T h e adjustments to the roll are based
on your Strength score, according to the
“Bonuses and Penalties” chart above. If
you have an adjustment, write it down
now, next to “Strength,” and remember
to use it each time you make a Hit Roll.
c. Saving Throws
Your Saving Throws are based on your
Character Class and Level of Experience. However, your Saving Throws will
not change until you reach 4th level (or
higher, for some Classes). All of your
beginning Saving Throws are given in
the description of your character’s Class.

bonuses o r penalties have been explained in the steps taken so far. You
should double-check to be sure they are
correct, using the Bonuses and Penalties
Table. All of these adjustments (if any)
should be written on your Character
Sheet in the spaces provided for them,
next to the Ability Scores.
Using the chart, fill in the bonus or

Charisma Score uses a different chart.
Intelligence
A character of “average” Intelligence (a
score of 9-12) knows 2 languages: the
Common tongue and an Alignment
tongue. T h e character can read and
write those languages.
If the adjustment is a bonus, this is the
number of additional languages the
character can read and write. Your Dungeon Master will tell you what languages
are available. You must choose your
added languages before you play the
character in a game.
If the adjustment is a penalty, then the
character has trouble either writing or

Languages can be important when you
are trying to talk to a monster, or talk in
private with another character.
Charisma
Your Charisma will affect the reactions
of others, whether monsters o r characters, when you are talking to them (but
not unless you are talking). If you try to
hire retainers (bodyguards, assistants,
and so forth), your Charisma will determine the number of them that you can
hire, and how loyal they will be. Your
Dungeon Master will tell you if any
retainers are available, and will play the
roles of the retainers you find and (possibly) hire.
Find your Charisma Score on the
Charisma Adjustment Table, and note
the details on your Character Sheet.
Whenever you are talking to another creature in the game (whether monster or
character), tell the Dungeon Master what
your Reaction adjustment is. If your Dungeon Master allows the use of Retainers,
you will need to give your Maximum
number, as well as the Morale score (which
is a measure of loyalty and courage). You
will not need to adjust any of your rolls due
to Charisma; only the Dungeon Master
will need the information.

9. Give your Character a Name and
Alignment
Names

your first adventure, and is covered in
detail on page 59. Select an Alignment,
and write it on your character sheet.
Remember that Alignment is the way
you actually want to play the character,

Your character may have a normal
name, like “Gary” or “Candace,” or may
have a fantasy name like “Felonius,” or
just a nickname, like “Eagle-Eyes.’’Your
Dungeon Master might have some hints.
For example, if your home town is in a
forest, the DM may encourage fantasy
names like “Silverglade” or “Whisperrain.”
Choose a name carefully. It should
represent the character in some way, or
at least be a name you like. If you give a
character a silly name, you might regret
it later.

10. Get ready to play

If your character can cast magic spells,
you will need to select spells before
starting your adventure. Magic-Users
get 1 spell to start. Clerics do not get
spells until they reach 2nd Level. MagicUser spells are explained on pages 39 42, and cleric spells are explained on
pages 26 - 27.
Your character will be adventuring
with others, so you should talk with the
other players to find out something
about their characters. Before starting,
you should understand how to play in a
group. This is explained on the following pages.

Alignment
Be sure you understand what Alignment is; it was explained briefly during

Players are not characters!
It is important to remember that the
player and the character are two different persons. T h e more the two are
kept apart, the better your games can be.
The most obvious example of this is the
dice rolls you make. All dice rolls are called
“game mechanics,” as are other details
such as Armor Class, Hit Points, and so
forth. These things would not be part of a
character’s knowledge. T h e characters
would talk about armor, health, and attacks, but never about Ability Scores, Hit
Rolls, or other parts of the game. Everyone can usually tell whether the players
are in the role of the characters or being
themselves, handling game mechanics.
If there is any doubt, the player
should clarify.
Suppose that a player has a Chaotic
character (unusual, but not impossible).
T h e character will act wildly at times, but
the player should remain calm while
dealing with the others. If the player acts
Chaotic, the game will become very confusing and less fun.
There are many ways that this can
affect the game, especially when a player knows something that the character doesn’t. For instance, if a character
starts to fight a new, unknown monster,

not just the way the character should
behave.
T h e other characters don’t need to
know what your Alignment is, but they
should be able to figure it out by the way
you play the character.

and the DM says “It hit you; save vs.
Poison, please!” then all the players
know that the monster is poisonous. But
the better players will ignore that information. Their characters don’t know
about the poison, and shouldn’t use that
“player information.” T h e characters
will probably find out after the battle,
when they talk to their wounded friend
and discover that the wound “stung, like
poison,” or is discolored. (All of such
descriptions are left to the DM’s imagination .)
A question like “What time is it?”
could be answered two different ways: in
“real time,” which any player can find by
looking at a clock, and “game time,” of
which the DM should be aware, but of
which the characters might only have a
general idea. T h e DM could reply, “Real
time, it’s 7:30. Game time, it’s past noon,
but you are not sure exactly.”
When the players remember the difference between themselves and their
characters, everyone can have more fun in
Role Playing. If a character has low Intelligence and Wisdom scores, for example,
and then does something stupid, the
player can honestly say “I was playing my
character,” and others should remember
not to get mad at the player. Their characters may indeed get mad at the stupid
52

character, but it is very important to remember that the player is a different
person.
This should not be used as an excuse
for bad or selfish play. T h e DM should
watch all the role playing closely to help
everyone have the most fun. Since the
object of the game is to have fun by
playing roles, stupid or weak characters
can be as much fun as smart, powerful
ones - if the roles are played well.
The Dungeon Master may say, at any
time in the game, “You don’t know that!”
or “You wouldn’t think of that.” Good
players will learn to avoid this type of
problem by keeping the character knowledge and player knowledge separate.

During the game, players should be
allowed to refer to the PLAYERS MANUAL whenever they wish. They should
not be allowed to see the DUNGEON
MASTER’S RULEBOOK during the
game! T h e mystery and excitement of
unknown monsters and magic can be
spoiled if someone looks up the details
during the game.
If you only have two or three players,
the DM may allow the use of a few hired
non-player characters, retainers. T h e
rules for retainers are given in the DUNGEON MASTER’S RULEBOOK.

Battles are always more complicated,
and the DM should then take the time to
check with each player, instead of handling it all through the Caller.
You may have games without Callers,
if the Dungeon Master is willing to ask
each player what each character is doing,
and make notes to remember the actions. But it’s usually easier and more
organized if one player acts as Caller.

Mapper and Caller

Who is your character, and who are the
other characters? Have you adventured
with them before, o r not? Are any of
them friends - or enemies? Should you
keep an eye on any one character? Who
can you trust completely?

Although each person will be playing
the role of a character, the players
should also handle the jobs of “Mapping” and “Calling.” Any of the players
can be the “Mapper” or “Caller,” whatever their characters may be.
T h e mapper is the player who draws a
map of the dungeon as it’s explored.
One or more of the characters should be
making maps, but one of the players
must make the actual game map. T h e
map should be kept out on the table for
all to see and refer to. Pencil should
always be used in making the map, in
case of errors and tricky passages.
Mapping is an important part of
imagining where your characters are.
Sooner or later, all players should learn
to make maps. If you play often, take
turns at mapping; it is an important and
useful skill to learn.
The caller is a player who announces to
the Dungeon Master what the group of
characters (the Party) is doing. The Caller
must check with every player to find out
what all the characters are doing, and then
tell the DM (quickly and accurately) what
they plan to do. The Caller does not tell
the others what to do; the Caller merely
reports what is going on.
T h e Caller’s first job is to find out the
“party order” - the way the characters
are lined up or grouped during normal
travel. The Caller should also report the
movements of the group, such as “We’ll
go northeast through the woods,” or
“We’ll turn right at the next corridor.”

First steps to take
When all the players are together, with
characters ready, each player should take a
moment to think about the adventure to
come. Some of these things apply to players, and some apply to the characters.

Why are you going? Are the characters
just out to explore, or is someone looking for a specific item? Are you out to
rescue a prisoner, destroy a famous
monster, or some other goal? Games are
usually more fun if a specific goal is kept
in mind; if nobody is sure just what they
want to do, you can waste a lot of time
doing nothing.
Where are you going? Nearby caves, or a
castle, or some other dungeon? Have
you bought the equipment you need to
explore?
When are you going? Do you plan to
explore a dungeon at night, when more
dangerous creatures could be around?
Players: decide when the game will end;
it’s very easy to play longer than you
intended. Set a time for quitting, and
stick to it! Remember to leave some time
for dividing the treasure found.
What are you going to do? Look for big
monsters or small ones? Will you run
from danger, or face it? What can your
party do, considering the abilities and
special items available amongst the characters?

Playing in a group
Treasure
Before the adventure begins, all the
players should decide how the treasure
will be divided after it is found. This is a
very important decision, as characters
earn more XP from treasure than from
anything else. T h e method of division is
left entirely to the players!
T h e most common method is described on page 5 5 . You may use it if you
wish, or you may make u p your own.
The method should be chosen before
starting, to avoid arguments later.
Marching Order
You should arrange your characters in a
line, either singly or two-by-two, for a
“Standard Marching Order.” If figures
are used, the DM can easily see everyone’s position; otherwise, write the
Marching Order on a piece of paper for
the DM’s reference.
You should have at least one Fighter
in front, as this is where most of the
action takes place. A short person (halfling or dwarf) should also be in front of
taller folk. Those behind may still see
clearly, and are able to cast spells or
shoot arrows over the shorter characters’
heads.
Weaker characters (Magic-Users and
Thieves, especially) should be in the
center of the Marching Order, protected
front and rear by Fighters or Clerics. If
this is not possible, the characters with
the best Armor Class and/or Hit Points
should occupy the outer positions.
If you change the Marching Order
during the game (if a front Fighter is
badly wounded, for example), be sure to
correct the figure setup (or the DM’s
diagram) accordingly.

Tactics of Play
When you are ready to go, your Dungeon Master will start telling you what
the characters see. In beginning games,
the characters often start at the dungeon
entrance; the DM then describes the
entryway, asking questions of the Caller
when choices can be made (“Turn right
or left?”). All the players should listen
carefully to the descriptions, and play
the roles of their characters as they react
to the situations that develop.
T h e Marching Order will be used as

the normal positioning of the characters

Ending the Adventure

as they proceed down corridors. In

empty rooms and after battles, party
members usually spread out to search
for hidden treasure, but someone
should be left to watch for approaching
monsters. T h e DM will keep track of
who is doing what, in case a monster
appears.
When creatures are encountered,
Fighters, Dwarves and Halflings usually
move toward the encounter, while
Magic-Users move back to avoid attacks,
adding their magical powers to the battles where needed. Thieves may also
move back, or may try to slip by the
encountered creatures if possible. A
Thief can help turn the tide of battle by
attacking a monster from behind (if the
creature doesn’t notice the Thief first).
Remember, however, that a clever DM
may have monsters arrive at the rear of
the party, occasionally when other monsters are at the front. T h e rear of the
party should never be left defenseless.
Clerics can often fill the need for a
strong guard, as they can wear armor
and fight well.
If an encounter is peaceful, those
characters with high Charisma Scores
should do most of the talking. If they are
weak, negotiations should be made from
a distance (ten to twenty feet is fine).
When special needs arise, those best
equipped to handle them should move
to the scene, while the rest of the characters stay in the Marching Order. For
example, a Thief should move forward
each time a door is found, to search for
traps and pick locks. After doing the job,
the Thief should move back into position. Thieves normally d o not open
doors, preferring to leave that task to the
stronger Fighters in case there is a monster waiting on the other side!
54

The end of a D&D game often comes
when the party’s resources have been used
up - for example, when spell casters have
used most of their spells, or when several
characters are wounded (having lost half
of their Hit Points, or more) and have no
available magical cures.
Even if all goes well, the game should
end 15-30 minutes before the planned
stopping time. T h e remaining time is
used by the DM to calculate and award
Experience Points, and by the players to
divide the treasure.
If characters are still in the dungeon
when they decide to end the adventure,
they must still find their way out and
back home. When they have arrived at a
safe location, the adventure ends.
Most Dungeon Masters allow shopping after the adventures, so characters
may restock items used (such as oil,
torches, and so forth). If this is left for
the next game, players might forget to
restock, and can find themselves short of
supplies while deep in a dungeon.
Players must keep track of items used,
and the DM should be strict about supplies. However, everyone should remember that the purpose of the game is
to have fun, not bookkeeping. The DM
should make allowances for beginners.
Characters who return to a safe place
resume their normal day-to-day lives.
Beginning players and DMs do not normally deal with this during games. The
“town business” that would naturally occur can become an adventure in itself. If
the DM has all the details of the Home
Town available (either those given in the
D&D EXPERT Set or details made up
by the DM), town adventures can be
very entertaining. They do not normally
involve much fighting.

Playing in a group
Dividing the Treasure
The amount of treasure your characters
find is decided by the Dungeon Master,
who places the treasures and monsters
in the dungeons. T h e DM is also responsible for giving Experience Points to the
characters at the end of the adventure.
The division of treasure is usually left
to the players, though some DMs have
their own rules for it, especially with
well-developed fantasy worlds. There
are several methods for dividing treasure, as both normal (coins, gems, and
jewelry) and magical (potions, wands,
etc.) treasures can be found.
As a rule, the division of treasure
should not be based on the amount of
work done by the different characters.
Fighters will usually be more active than
others, and thieves may have little to do;
though the role may be played well,
there nlay be few traps and locks to deal
with. B ut each character risked danger
in sear1ch of treasure, and each should
have dcm e special work as needed; it is
not tht3 character’s fault if few needs
arose.
Begi nning players should use the following method for dividing treasure.
Other 1methods are discussed at the end
of this booklet. But whatever methods
are use,d, they should be decided upon
before tkle party goes on the adventure, to
avoid a rguments afterwards.
Magica11 Treasure
Magica1 treasures are usually divided
first, as, the results affect the division of
normal treasure.
Each character may pick one item
(each) jfrom the magical treasure found.
The 01rder in which they choose may
either be decided as a group or by
randonn roll. If by random roll, each
player rolls ld20; the player with the
highest roll picks first. If there is a tie,
everyoine rolls again. When all the magic
items klave been taken, divide the normal treasure.
Normal Treasure
Count the number of shares to be given,
using the following method.
Some magic items are “permanent.” A
magic sword, for example, is never
“used up,” but a potion is only good for
one use. A potion is called a “temporary”
magic item.

If all the characters in a party get a
permanent magic item, divide all normal
treasure equally, whatever the division
of any temporary magic items.
If everyone gets a magic item but one
or more of the items are temporary,
each character with a permanent item
gets Yz share of normal treasure.
If there are not enough magic items for
one to be gained by each character then Y,
share of normal treasure goes to each
character with a temporary magic item,
but a character with a permanent magic
item gets no share of normal treasure.
Finally, divide the total normal treasure by the number of shares (adding the
number of Y2 shares and full shares
according to the instructions above), to
find the value of each SHARE. Each
character then takes one share, Yz share,
or no share, depending on the distribution of magic items.
This method is fair; those who receive
permanent magic items, which can be
used in every adventure, get less treasure.

Character Alignment
Three basic ways of life guide the acts of
both player characters and monsters.
Each way of life is called an alignment.
T h e three alignments are named Law,
Chaos, and Neutrality. Each alignment
has a language that includes hand signals and other body motions. Player
characters always know how to speak
their alignment language in addition to
any others they may know. If a monster
is able to speak, it will also be able to use
its alignment language.
Players may choose the alignments
they feel will best fit their characters. A
player does not have to tell other players
what alignment he or she has picked, but
must tell the DM. Most Lawful characters will reveal their alignment if asked.
When picking alignments, the characters should know that Chaotics cannot
be trusted, even by other Chaotics. A
Chaotic character does not work well
with other player characters.
The alignments give guidelines for
characters to live by. T h e characters will
try to follow these guidelines, but may
not always be successful. If a DM feels
that a player is not keeping to a character’s chosen alignment, the DM may
suggest a change of alignment or give
the character a punishment or penalty.
55

Law (or Lawful) is the belief that everything should follow an order, and that
obeying rules is the natural way of life.
Lawful creatures will try to tell the truth,
obey laws, and care about all living
things. Lawful characters always try to
keep their promises. They will try to
obey laws as long as such laws are fair
and just.
If a choice must be made between the
benefit of a group or an individual, a
Lawful character will usually choose the
group. Sometimes individual freedoms
must be given u p for the good of the
group. Lawful characters and monsters
often act in predictable ways. Lawful
behavior is usually the same as behavior
that could be called “good.”
Chaos (or Chaotic) is the opposite of
Law. It is the belief that life is random,
and that chance and luck rule the world.
Everything happens by accident and
nothing can be predicted. Laws are
made to be broken, as long as a person
can get away with it. It is not important
to keep promises, and lying and telling
the truth are both useful.
To a Chaotic creature, the individual
is the most important of all things. Selfishness is the normal way of life, and the
group is not important. Chaotics often
act on sudden desires and whims. They
cannot be trusted, their behavior is hard
to predict. They have strong belief in the
power of luck. Chaotic behavior is usually the same as behavior that could be
called “evil.”
Neutrality (or Neutral) is the belief that
the world is a balance between Law and
Chaos. It is important that neither side
get too much power and upset this balance. T h e individual is important, but SO
is the group; the two sides must work
together.
A Neutral character is most interested
in personal survival. Such characters believe in their own wits and abilities rather
than luck. They tend to return the treatment they receive from others. Neutral
characters will join a party if they think it
is in their own best interest, but will not
be overly helpful unless there is some
sort of profit in it. Neutral behavior may
be considered “good” or “evil” (or neither), depending on the situation.

Playing in a group
Example of Alignment Behavior
T H E SITUATION: A group of player
characters is attacked by a large number
of monsters. Escape is not possible unless the monsters are slowed down.
A Lawful character will fight to protect
the group, whatever the danger. T h e
character will not run away unless the
whole group does.
A Neutral character will fight to protect the
group as long as it is reasonably safe to do
so. If the danger gets too great, the charac-

ter will try to save himself (or herself), even
at the expense of the party.
A Chaotic character might fight the monsters or might run away. T h e character
will not care what happens to the rest of
the party.
Alignment Languages
Each alignment has a secret language of
passwords, hand signals, and other body
motions. Player characters and intelligent monsters will always know their
alignment languages. They will also rec-

ognize when another alignment language is being spoken, but will not understand it. Alignment languages are
not written down, nor may they be
learned unless a character changes alignment. When this happens, the character
forgets the old alignment language and
starts using the new one immediately.
Note that playing an alignment does
not mean a character must do stupid
things. A character should always act as
intelligently as the Intelligence score
shows, unless there is a reason to act
otherwise (such as a magical curse).

Adventuring Rules
Here are some additional details you will
need at some point during your adventures.
Using Your Equipment
Some of the standard equipment may be
new to you. T h e following items can be
used in various handy ways:
Iron spikes and Hammer: These can
be used to wedge doors open, provide grips for climbing, pry things
loose, and so forth.
Mirror: Some creatures can turn you
to stone with their gaze. If you use a
mirror to look around corners, examine empty rooms, and so forth, you
might avoid a nasty surprise.
Rations and Wineskin: Your character food and drink. Standard rations
may become moldy and unusable if
you stay in a dungeon overnight, so
carry Iron (preserved) rations whenever possible. Standard rations are
fine for long trips overland.
Rope: This can be tied to an iron
spike and used to climb u p steep
walls. It may also be useful in tying u p
captured prisoners, pulling doors,
open, etc.
Wolfsbane: This herb is useful when
fighting werewolves and other lycanthropes. You may use it as a weapon
- try it and see what happens.
Wooden Pole: A character in front of
a party may sometimes avoid being
surprised if a pole is used to tap on
the floor ahead, poke into corners,
touch suspicious-looking items, etc.

Time

Movement

Time in D&D games is usually kept track
of in turns of 10 minutes in “game time.” A
turn is not a measure of real time, but is a
measure of how much a character can do
in the game in a given amount of time.
During encounters and combat, the
DM uses rounds of 10 seconds of ‘‘gam?
time,” instead of turns, and each character can perform only one action during a
round - a swing of a sword, a spell,
some movement, or other action. A battle normally lasts only a minute or two,
but is counted as a full turn because your
characters rest afterwards, clean u p their
equipment, and do other assumed normal actions.
In D&D games, it would take too long
for you to describe each action your
character takes. Many actions are assumed, and do not need to be talked
about - such as eating, resting after and
during travel, normal careful behavior,
and so forth. T h e DM should decide
how long any action takes.
Time for you, the players, is called
“real time” to avoid confusion. A game
usually takes 2-3 hours of real time, but
may last for days in game time. T h e DM
may say, for example, “you take two
hours to walk to the dungeon, and . . . .”
On the other hand, it may take you half
an hour of real time to play a battle that
lasts only a few minutes of game time.

In D&D games movement is given as the
number of feet a character may move in
one turn.
A single character moves u p to 120’
per turn in a dungeon-like setting unless
a lot of weight (such as armor) is carried.
T h e movement speed may slow down to
as little as 30‘ per turn, depending on
the amount carried. Groups move at the
rate of the slowest character. A character
wearing heavy armor moves at half the
normal rate: 60’ per turn.
Though 60’ per turn may seem very
slow, it includes many assumed actions
- mapping, peeking around corners,
resting, and so forth.
During encounters, movement is
much faster. Characters can move b3‘
their movement rate per round, u p to
40’ per round during battles (20’ per
round if in armor). In addition, you may
run away from creatures, at the even
faster rate of 120’ (or 60’ if armored)
per round. However, you may only run
for 20 rounds at most (5 minutes) before
becoming exhausted. If you are exhausted, you must rest for 3 turns (30
minutes).
If you are forced to fight without rest,
the exhausted characters are penalized
in combat. Monsters gain a 2 bonus to
their Hit Rolls, and you must subtract 2
from all your characters’ Hit Rolls and
Damage Rolls. (Any successful hit will
still inflict at least 1 point of damage.)

Playing in a group
Listelning
You Iihould always listen carefully while
you aire exploring a dungeon; you may
hear noises that give clues about what
lies aihead. To hear anything, all the
characters must stop moving and be
very quiet. Armor and weapons clank
and r attle when you move, spoiling your
attem pts at listening.
To listen for noise, simply tell the DM
that JIOU are doing so. T h e DM will roll
to see’ if you hear anything. When listening at closed doors, each character can
try o nce. Thieves have better chances
than other characters. Undead creatures., like skeletons and ghouls, make no
noise at all.
Light
Most dungeons are dark. Be sure to
bring a tinderbox, which contains wood
shaviings, flint rocks, and a small piece of
steel. ( N o matches or lighters in this
medic~ v a worid!)
l
Yo1I will also need something to light
with 1your tinderbox. A torch is cheapest,
and 1will burn for 6 turns (1 hour). It
cannc)t easily be “turned off.” A lantern is
more expensive and uses oil. One flask of
oil wi11 burn for 24 turns (4 hours) in a
lantern. The lantern must then be refilled,
using another flask of oil. A lantern has
shuttc:rs, which can be closed for temporary (darkness if desired. A torch or lantern 5ihines 30’ in all directions.
If you are carrying a light source (a
torch or lantern), other creatures will
prob:ibly see the light as you approach,
and 1vi11 not be surprised.
Re member that you only have two
hand s. If you are carrying a light source
in on e hand, then the other hand may
hold a weapon or a shield - but not both.
DMiarves and elves have Infravision, a
speci;a1 ability which enables them to see
60’ in the dark by seeing heat. This
meanIS that they can move and fight
withciut light, but it’s risky. They cannot
see a pit in the floor, for example, unless
it is vvarmer than the air above it. They
may :also stumble over objects which are
the s,ame temperature as the floor, unless tlhey are very careful.
DoorS
You will find two kinds of doors in
dung‘eons, normal and secret doors.

A noirmal door is made of wood, and
often has metal reinforcing strips across
it. Sc)me have metal hinges, a ring or

doorknob, and possibly a lock, either a
padlock hanging on a latch or a lock
inset into the door. Normal doors can
often be forced or broken open, but a
strong bar of wood mounted on the
other side will prevent this.
To open a normal door, just tell your
DM that you are doing so. T h e DM will
assume that you are turning the handle,
pulling the ring, or pushing on it gently.
If it doesn’t open, you may tell the DM
“I’ll force the door.” Your character is
then using Strength to open it, which
may be successful if the door is merely
stuck quite (quite common in dungeons). If the door still does not open, it
may be locked, barred, or closed magically; or your attempt might have simply been unsuccessful, based on a dice
roll. Try again! However, if a door is not
opened on the first t r y at forcing it, any
monsters on the other side will not be
surprised by your party.
A secret door does not look like a door.
It may simply be a section of wall that
can be moved, or may be a small normal
door hidden behind a curtain, rug, or
some other furnishing. Any character
may look for secret doors, but they are
psually hard to find. Your DM will roll to
see if you succeed, but you must tell the
DM that you are searching for one, and
where.

It takes 10 minutes (1 turn) of searching a 10’ x 10’ area to find a secret door.
Less time will mean automatic failure.
Traps
Dungeons often contain traps. Old ruins
usually have more traps than caves. The
most common trap is a hidden trap door,
which falls open as a character walks on it,
dumping the character into a pit. There
could be something in the pit - spikes,
deep water, or a monster. Beware!
Many other traps are possible. A chest
or treasure may be coated with poison;
deadly if touched, but easily removed by
rinsing with water. Some poisons are
sticky, and can only be removed with wine.
A blade trap may be found nearly anywhere, and usually inflicts enough damage
to kill a 1st or 2nd level character.
Doors may be trapped on the handles,
locks, or surface. Small darts may be

57

found inside a lock, and may be poisoned for many different effects (paralysis, damage, death, etc.).
If you wish to search for a trap, tell the
DM where you are searching, and the DM
will roll to see if you find anything. You
might have no chance to find a small trap,
such as the type on a door or treasure.
Thieves have a percentage chance at detecting any type of trap. Dwarves have
better chances at finding large traps (such
as pits) than other characters.
It takes 10 minutes (1 turn) to search for
a trap in a small area, such as a 20’ square
room or a 20’ long section of corridor. If
less time is spent, no trap will be found.
Wandering Monsters
You will usually encounter monsters in
rooms, rather than corridors. But the
DM makes dice rolls to see if any Wandering Monsters come by. This type of
creature usually has little or no treasure,
and is a dangerous nuisance.
Wandering monsters are often determined by the type of dungeon. For
example, caves could contain wandering
animals. A castle ruin might contain
wandering skeleton guards.
Miniature Figures
As you try to imagine your characters
and the areas they explore, it is helpful
to use miniature figures to represent the
characters and monsters. Several types
of miniature figures are available from
toy and hobby shops worldwide, made
of metal or plastic and suitable for painting. You should be able to find figures
that look very similar to your characters.
Official DUNGEONS & DRAGONS@
figures are available.
To keep track of the party marching
order, line u p the miniature figures on
the playing table. You may use a large
piece of graph paper to draw the rooms
and corridors found by the characters,
and simply move the figures around on
the paper. Several types of more permanent playing surfaces are available in
plastic and vinyl, and the rooms drawn
on them can be easily erased.
Scale Movement: When using miniature
figures on a playing surface, a ruler is
used to determine distance moved. One
inch represents 10 feet. A movement
rate of 60‘ per turn means that the
figure moves 6 inches each turn. Spell
ranges and other ranges are easily determined when an accurate scale is used.

Playing in a group
Encounter Rules
Surprise
There is more to an encounter than just
walking into a room and seeing a monster. For example, you might have
sneaked u p on the creature - or it
might have sneaked u p on you! You
might turn a corner, and be completely
surprised to find a monster right there.
But if the monster is surprised, too, then
you would both stop for a moment and
look at each other. T h e mutual surprise
on both sides would cancel out, for no
effect except a short delay.
For example, let’s look back at your
very first encounter - with the goblin.
You entered the room, and the goblin
screamed and swung his sword at you,
but missed. You didn’t get to do anything before he had swung, because you
were surprised.
In the one-player adventure in this
booklet, surprise has already been
worked out. T h e description tells you
whether you or the monsters - or both!
- are surprised.
In group adventures, you roll to see
who is surprised, and by how much. A
six-sided die (ld6) is rolled for each side,
and the results are compared in the
following way:
You are only surprised if you roll a 1 or a
2; the same applies to the monsters.

This is called Initiative. If you have the
initiative, you get to act first, before the
monster.
In all of your group’s encounters, you
will roll to see who has the initiative. T h e
DM rolls ld6 for the monsters, and one
of the players rolls ld6 for the charactqrs. It doesn’t matter which player rolls.
Whoever gets the higher number wins
the initiative, and swings first.
When the party has the initiative, the
characters may use the time to talk,
attack, move (fighters moving to the
front, for example), or run away. Some
monsters will also have similar choices,
but most will either talk or attack. Very
few monsters run away before anything
happens.
If a monster has more than one attack, it will get all of its attacks before
yours if it wins the initiative.
If each side rolls the same number,
then all the action happens at once; the
actions are “simultaneous,” and neither
side wins the initiative. Attacking characters can try to Hit, but whatever the
result, the monsters may also make all of
their attacks, even if you kill them with
your first attacks!
Pursuit and Evasion
If either side decides to run away, the
other side may chase. Time is measured
in rounds for as long as the chase occurs.
T h e side running away is “Evading,”and
those chasing are in “Pursuit.”

If both sides are surprised, neither side
can move or fight during that round.
T h e mutual surprise cancels out. For
the next round, either side might go
first, so another roll (on l d 6 again) is
used to decide. This is called rolling
for Initiative, and is described below.

You may evade monsters if you can
move faster than they can and if you
know where you are going - so once
again, a map becomes important. If the
monsters are catching up, try dropping
things! Unintelligent monsters may stop
to eat food. Intelligent monsters may
stop to pick u p treasure. In each case,
there is a 50% chance that the monsters
will stop or slow down. Your DM will
make all the necessary rolls.

ORDER OF COMBAT
A. Each side rolls for initiative, using
ld6.
B. T h e side that wins the initiative
acts first:
1. Morale Check (monsters and
non-player characters only)
2. Movement (using speed per
round), including Defensive
Maneuvers
3. Missile fire combat (additional)
a. Choose targets
b. Make Hit Rolls
c. Roll Damage for hits
4. Magic spells
a. Choose targets
b. Make Saving Throws if necessary
c. Apply results immediately
5. Hand-to-Hand combat
a. Choose targets
b. Make Hit Rolls
c. Roll Damage for hits
C. T h e side that loses the initiative
then completes all the steps given
above.
D. T h e DM handles all retreating,
surrender, and other special results.

Combat Sequence

If one side surprises the other, the
surprised side must wait during the
first round, while the other side acts.
Those that can act might spend the
time attacking, talking, or moving even running away!

During a battle, the actions do not all
happen at once. Your DM will use a
checklist to be sure that the battle is run
properly. T h e list is also given here for
your reference.
This Combat Sequence includes several optional rules. If you are not using
the rule referred to (such as Missile
Fire), simply skip that step.
Repeat steps A through D as needed
until the battle is over.

If neither side is surprised, the DM
must determine which side acts first
in the round, by checking Initiative.
Initiative
When an encounter begins, you might
act first, or the monster might go first.

Additional rules
The following rules should not be used
by beginners. They may be added after
you have played two or three group
games.

thrown, Strength bonuses are used znstead of Dexterity, and no adjustments
are made for Range or Cover. A dagger
or hand axe may be thrown at an opponent within range. Each spins in the air
striking with the blade forward.
A spear is a long shaft of wood or
metal with a sharp tip, and can be
thrown straight at an opponent. It has
the best range of any thrown missile.

Missile Weapons
You have learned what to d o when your
character gets into a fight, but so far, you
have only used a sword or dagger. These
are called “hand-to-hand” or “melee”
weapons (pronounced MAY-lay). Other
types, called “missile weapons,” such as
bow and arrows, are handled somewhat
differently.
Missile fire is a type of combat used
when the enemy is too far away to fight
hand-to-hand - in other words, more
than 5 feet away. Missile fire can be
affected by the distance to the enemy
(Range), objects that the enemy can hide
behind (Cover), the attacker’s Dexterity
Score, and magic adjustments, if any.
Not all missiles are actual weapons.
Missile fire rules also apply when a character throws something at a monster,
such as oil or holy water.
The various types of Missile fire you
can use, and the ranges for them, are
listed on the Missile Fire Table:
The first group of weapons are devices
that fire missiles; the second group are
missiles your character throws by hand.
Whenever your character buys one of
these items, you should make a note of
the ranges. For example, a Long Bow
should be listed as 70-140-210, the longest distances it can shoot in each Range
category.
Device: A missile fire device is a weapon
that fires missiles, such as a bow or
crossbow. Devices cannot be used in

Holy Water: This is water which has
been specially prepared by a Cleric for
use against Undead creatures. It can be
used by any character. Holy Water must
be kept in small, specially prepared glass
bottles (known as vials) for it to remain
Holy. T h e effect of one vial of Holy
Water on an Undead creature is 1-8
(ld8) points of damage. For it to cause
damage, it must successfully strike the
target, thus breaking the vial. It may
either be thrown (using missile fire
rules) or used hand-to-hand (using normal combat rules.
hand-to-hand combat, or against targets
within 5 feet.
A crossbow is similar to a normal bow
(long or short), but is held horizontally
and shot by pulling a trigger, which
releases the string.
A sling is a leather pocket with long
strings; the user holds the strings and
puts a stone in the pocket. T h e stone is
thrown by swinging it around and releasing one string at the right time. A
sling is the only missile weapon usable by
Clerics.
Thrown Weapons: A spear, dagger, or
hand axe may be either thrown or held.
They are good weapons to use when the
monsters are nearby, as the character
can use any thrown weapon in hand-tohand combat. If the weapon is not

Oil: Oil is carried in small bottles
(known as Flasks), and is often thrown as
missiles. It may also be spread on a floor.
In either case, it will be slippery but not
dangerous until it is lit by flame.
One flask of oil will make a pool 3’ in
diameter, which will burn out in one
turn if lit. Burning oil will cause 1-8 (ld8)
points of damage per round to victims in
the flames, including any creature trying
to cross a pool of burning oil. Oil thrown
at a creature will either miss (forming a
pool where it falls) or hit. If it hits, it will
drip off in a few rounds; if lit, the victim
will take damage for 2 rounds at most.
Oil may be lit with any flame, such as a
torch. If a torch is thrown at a creature,
another Hit Roll must be made, but the
creature’s normal AC is not used; the
target of any thrown torch is treated as
AC 10, regardless of the actual Armor
Class of the target (but the roll is adjusted as explained below).
As with Holy Water, oil may be used
either as a missile or in hand-to-hand
combat.
Missile Fire Hit Roll Modifications
Missile fire rules are used when the
target is 5’ away or more. Normal combat rules are used if the target is within
5 ‘ . A missile fire device will automatically miss a target within 5’ unless the
target cannot move.

Playing in a group
When your character tries to use any
type of missile fire, adjust your normal
Hit Roll for the following things:
1. Dexterity

applies here. In your adventures, you
may discover magical missiles - arrows,
crossbow bolts, and so forth - and
bonuses from such magic also apply to
your Hit Roll.

2. Range
3. Cover
4. Magic

Variable Weapon Damage

1. Dexterity: Include any bonuses or
penalties to your Hit Roll due to high or
low Dexterity. You may have an adjustment from - 3 to + 3 , depending on
your Dexterity Score (as given in the
“Bonuses a n d Penalties for Ability
Scores” chart, on page 50).

Whenever you hit a monster in your
adventures so far, your character’s
weapon inflicted 1-6 (ld6) points of
damage. But if we consider the battle
realistically, a dagger should do less
damage than a sword (for example).
This advanced damage system allows
different weapons to inflict different
amounts of damage. T h e damage done
by each weapon type is given on the
chart below.
Some weapons can only be properly
used with two hands. These are noted
with an asterisk (*).
T h e large amount of damage done by
two-handed weapons is balanced by two
penalties: the attacker cannot use a shield,
and will always lose the initiative, whatever
the roll may be. T h e lack of a shield will
reduce the character’s Armor Class
while that weapon is being used (unless,
of course, no shield was used in the first
place).

2. Range: A weapon can only be thrown
or shot to the longest distance on the
chart. This is called weapon’s range. For
example, you can’t throw a spear any
further than 60 feet.
Ask your DM what the range to the
target is, in feet. T h e DM may prefer to
give you the general range instead of the
exact distance, and may ask you which
missile weapon you are using.
If the range is short, you add 1 to your
Hit Roll. If the distance to the target is
between the numbers given for short and
medium ranges, there is no adjustment. If
the distance to the target is greater than
the number given for medium range, but
still within the maximum range, you
must subtract 1 from your Hit Roll. (The
bonus and penalty are noted on the
chart, as a reminder.)
Thus, a crossbow can shoot farther
than any other weapon, and an axe or
dagger can only be thrown at a nearby
target.
3. Cover: T h e enemy may be harder to
hit because it is hiding behind something; this is called cover. Cover could be
gained by hiding behind a table or chair,
or a tree or boulder outdoors. A shield
does not provide cover.
If cover is used, your DM should
mention that the monster has cover and
will apply penalties to your chances to
hit. You should always be told if the
monster has cover, but you might not
know how many penalties apply. These
penalties are determined by the DM and
range from - 1 for partial cover to - 4
for full cover.

4. Magic: If you are under a magic spell
which helps your chances to hit, that

Combat Maneuvers
T h e following special forms of defensive
movement are usable by any character in
hand-to-hand combat. They may also be
used by monsters. If a player wants to
use one of these maneuvers, he or she
must say so before rolling for initiative.
These maneuvers may not be used if not
declared before that roll.
If a character is near a battle but is not
fighting hand-to-hand, that character may
move normally. The movement rate depends on the amount of weight carried, as
explained in the section on Encumbrance.
Any monster or character using a
maneuver explained hereafter is called
the “defender.” T h e opponent is called
the “attacker.”
Fighting Withdrawal
If a defender is engaged in combat and
wishes to back up slowly while fighting, the
maneuver is called a Fighting Withdrawal.
T h e defender must have room to
back up. In crowded situations, those
behind the defender will get in the way,
preventing the maneuver from succeeding! If room permits, the defender may
move at Y2 the normal movement rate,
or less. T h e attacker may follow and
continue attacking, but the defender
may attack in return.
Retreat
If a defender wants to back out of a fight
at more than Yz the normal movement
rate, the maneuver is called a Retreat.
T h e attacker gains a 2 bonus on all
Hit Rolls, and the defender’s AC is calculated without a shield. T h e defender
may not attack in return.

+

Playing in a group
Paired Combat
When you begin a battle, both sides roll
for initiative. This one roll has applied to
everyone on each side.
Your DM may choose, for small battles,
to determine initiative for each monster or
character instead of the whole group.
When this is done, each player rolls for
initiative, adjusting the roll by Dexterity
bonuses or penalties as given on the following table. The DM will roll for each
monster involved in actual combat, adjusting the roll if the monster is very slow or
very fast. Most monsters have no adjustments to Paired Combat. One other initiative roll may be needed for other monsters
not in hand-to-hand combat, if any, compared to a similar roll for characters not
engaged in battle.

This can become silly, if allowed to
continue. Your characters may eventually find vast dragon hoards of thousands of coins, weighing hundreds of
pounds, and the DM should not permit
you to pick it all u p and walk out!
Encumbrance is the name for the
amount of weight that your character is
carrying. T h e more you carry, the
slower you move, according to the following chart. One new abbreviation is
used. One coin of treasure, whatever the
type (gp, ep, and so forth) weighs about
f i o pound. Since coins are the commonest of treasures, the coin (not the
pound) becomes the simplest unit of
weight. From now on, the weight of all
treasures, equipment, and so forth will
be measured in coins, abbreviated cn.

Encumbrance
There have been no rules in your games
thus far dealing with the amount a character can carry. You have been allowed
to pick u p as much treasure as you can
find, and take it home.

“Normal speed” is used when your characters are walking through a dungeon.
“Encounter speed” is used whenever
time is kept in rounds, such as during a
battle.
“Running speed” is used whenever the
party is running away from an encounter.
Time is still kept in rounds, rather than
turns, and the party must rest afterward.
(See Movement, page 56.)

Basic Encumbrance
If a character is wearing no armor, or
merely leather armor, and carrying the
normal equipment taken on an adventure, the basic encumbrance is 300 cn.
That type of character can pick u p 100
coins and still use the top line of the
chart. If more treasure is carried, the
rest of the table is used to find the
movement rate.

If a character is wearing metal armor,
whether Chain Mail or Plate Mail, and
carrying other normal equipment, the
basic encumbrance is 700 cn. The character moves at 90’/turn, and may pick up
100 coins and still use that line of the chart.
A character carrying more than 2400
cn (240 pounds) cannot move. Something must be dropped or given to other
characters.

Using Encumbrance
Find the basic encumbrance for your
character, as explained above, and write
it on the back of your character sheet,
under “Equipment.” Remember to add
to it whenever you pick u p any treasure;
your DM will tell you how many coins
are found. A gem is counted as 1 cn, and
other treasures (potions, jewelry, and so
forth) are counted as 10 cn each.
A m o r e detailed system of encumbrance, calculating the weight of
each piece of equipment, will be given in
the D&D EXPERT Set. But remember
that the fun of the game comes from
role playing, not bookkeeping, and your
DM may merely wish to use a simple
system for determining encumbrance.

Containers
Your character could not possibly carry
even a few hundred coins unless they
were placed in a sack or backpack. These
items will hold:
Small sack
Backpack
Large sack

200 cn
400 cn
600 cn

Mules
Saddlebags may also be used if your DM
allows mules to be bought. A saddlebag
will hold 1000 cn. A mule normally
moves at the same rate as a character,
120’ per turn, and can carry u p to 3000
cn while doing so. A mule can carry
6000 cn at most, which cuts its movement rate in half.

Playing in a group
Retainers
A retainer is a person hired by a character to help on an adventure. Retainers
are sometimes called “hirelings.” Retainers are never characters run by players; the DM always plays the part of any
retainers hired. They are called NonPlayer Characters, or NPCs. All the
people in any D&D game other than the
characters, are NPCs.
Ask your DM if retainers are permitted in the game. You cannot use retainers if there are plenty of player
characters, or PCs to do the jobs. In a
game with only one or two players,
retainers are often used.
If you want to hire a retainer, use the
following procedure:

1. Find NPCs interested in working as
retainers.
2. Tell them about the job, including the
pay you offer, what is expected of
them, and how long you intend to
keep them.
3. Some NPCs will turn down your offer, but some will probably accept. If
you find one that is acceptable, buy
all the equipment the NPC will need.
4. Make a “retainer sheet” to be kept
with your character sheet. This
should be similar to the character
information, including the retainer’s

name, Class, Level, race, Armor
Class, Hit Points, weapons and equipment carried, Money, Experience
Points, and any other information
you wish to remember.

Vz the normal award, and is treated as Yz
character for the division.

Using Retainers
When you check your character to see if
you are ready for adventure, check the
retainer sheet at the same time. Remember that you must buy all the equipment
that the retainer needs.
During the adventure, tell your DM
whatever you want to tell the retainer;
the DM will play the role of the retainer.
A retainer will not simply do whatever
you want, though most reasonable instructions will be obeyed. T h e retainer
might run away from danger, despite
your instructions. This is determined by
dice rolls made by the DM.
Your retainer does not normally get a
share of the treasure found on an adventure. When you hire a retainer, be
sure to clearly state the amount you will
pay. If you find enough treasure to pay
the retainer a bonus, that may make the
retainer more loyal. In other words, the
well-treated retainer will face greater
dangers without running away, and will
obey your instructions more often.
When the DM calculates XP at the
end of an adventure, the total XP
earned by the group is divided by the
number of characters. A retainer gets

You must keep track of the XP for
your retainer, using the retainer sheet. A
retainer may have a bonus or penalty to
the XP awarded, calculated in the same
manner as XP for characters (explained
in t h e DUNGEON MASTER’S
RULEBOOK). In the example above, if
the retainer’s Prime Requisite score was
8, the retainer would only get 45 XP (a
10% penalty).
Your retainer may quit the job if
treated badly. Otherwise, the retainer
will stay either until dismissed by your
character or until gaining one or more
Levels of Experience. For example, if
you hire a retainer for 1 month, the
retainer will probably leave at the end of
that month. But if the retainer is close to
gaining a Level, he or she may ask to stay
a bit longer. T h e decision will be up to
you.
When your retainer quits, give the
retainer sheet to the DM. T h e DM can
use that character, and you may meet
the retainer again later, in another game
or in another town!

The World of D&D Gaming
Finding Other Players
T h e DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game
is much more fun when played by
groups than when played alone. Show or
lend this booklet to a friend, so you can
quickly start playing in a group. Each
player can learn by playing through the
Solo Adventures, just as you did.
You will probably be able to find
others who already know how to play.
Many of the best belong to the Official
DUNGEONS & DRAGONS club, called
the ROLE PLAYING GAME ASSOCIATION Network.
This is the only Official D&D Club,
and offers a newsletter, special items,
ways to find other players, and many
other services, for a small fee - less than
the cost of this game!
TM

There are many other ways to find
other players. Your local hobby shop
may have a bulletin board where Dungeon Masters can post notices of regular
games. Your school or library may also
have news about other players and DMs.
Higher Level Characters
T h e dungeons for your characters to
explore are often made up by the Dungeon Master. However, they can also be
purchased, ready to play! You can buy
pre-made adventures called “Modules,”
from TSR and some are designed specifically for use with this set of rules. As this
is called the “BASIC” set, the modules
that go with it are the “B” modules.
When your characters reach the 3rd
Level of Experience, you should be al-

62

most ready for the D&D EXPERT Set. It
gives more spells, rules for character
levels 4th through 14th, and everything
you need to improve your games. The
modules designed for use with these
additional rules are in the “X” series.
T h e fun continues with the D&D
COMPANION Set, which covers character levels 15th through 24th.
Eventually you will be ready for the
D&D MASTERS set, with rules for character Levels 25 and above.
T h e other modules you may find,
with many other letter designations, are
not designed for these rules. They are
for use with the ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS@game system.

Glossary
Other Player Aids
As you can see, there is much more fun
waiting for you in the DUNGEONS &
DRAGONS game system. And there is
even more than games - a whole
Hobby awaits!

Character Sheets: You will probably
want more Character Sheets when you
start making u p many of your own
characters. They are available in a separate pack of 16. Be sure to get D&D@
Character Sheets, not AD&D sheets, as
both are available.
Dice: More dice can be purchased in
sets, called DRAGON DICE'" random
number generators. Each package includes one of each type (four-sided, sixsided, and so forth), plus a crayon to
color the numbers with.
Miniatures: If you wish, you can purchase toy figures of your characters (and
monsters, too). These figures can help
you imagine better, because they give
you something to look at. Imagine a
battle with seven characters, fighting ten
monsters! It's hard to imagine exactly
what everybody is doing, so we often use
figures to help keep track of where
everybody is.
If you wish to use miniature figures,
be sure to get DUNGEONS & DRAGONS or AD&D miniatures. T h e other
game systems do not use the same characters and monsters. Official figures are
available in both plastic and metal.
If you wish to paint your miniatures
with realistic colors, Official D&D paints,
colors and finishes are also available at
better toy and hobby stores worldwide.
ADVANCED DUNGEONS 8c
DRAGONS@Games
T h e AD&D@game system is different
from the D&D system, which you have
now. It is also a fantasy role playing
game, but is much harder and more
detailed.
There are currently six hardback
books of rules for the AD&D system.
Since it is so much more complex than
the D&D system, with established rules
for almost everything, it is often used in
large tournaments, where accurate rules
are needed.
Remember: you are not playing the
more complex AD&D games with these
rules. You are playing the original DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game!

Introduction
Read through this booklet from front to
back, just as you did the PLAYERS’ MANUAL. A vast wealth of information awaits
you!
In your adventures so far, you have met
many fearsome monsters - goblins, skeletons, and even a Rust Monster. There are
dozens of other monsters described in this
booklet.
You have found treasures - coins of all
types, gems, and a magical potion. There
are dozens of other treasures here.
You have visited a “dungeon” - some
caves near a town. There is a new dungeon
in this booklet!
You will also learn how to put all these
things together, make your own dungeons,
run games for other players, and probably
have more fun than you ever imagined.

Terms and Abbreviations
Let’s review the most commonly used
terms in the game; they will often be used
in this booklet.
A character being run by a player is
simply called a Player Character, or “PC.”
The D&D games you will run are actually
stories about the PCs in a fantasy world,
and you and your players will make up
these stories together. You will play the
roles of the Non-Player Characters
(NPCs) and monsters.
Take a moment to review these terms
and abbreviations and become familiar
with them:

Definitions:

<

Character: Any imaginary person (human,
dwarf, elf, or halfling) in a D&D game.
Player: A person who plays the role of a
character in a D&D game.
Adventurer: Any character which seeks
adventure, daring to face monsters and
dangers in search of fame and fortune.
Class: The profession of an adventurer.
Party: A group of adventurers, gathered
to share their talents for the good of all.
Monster: Any creature that is not a character.
Normal Man: A typical townsperson, who
is not an adventurer.
Treasure: Any valuable item, usually a coin,
gem, piece of jewelry, or magic item.
Dungeon: Any place where monsters and
treasures can be found (including caves,
old ruins, and so forth).
Dungeon Master: A person who runs a
D&D game, playing the roles of the
monsters.
Non-Player Character: Any character that
is run by the Dungeon Master instead of
a Player.

Level: A number indicating the power of
an adventurer or a spell.
Alignment: A term generally describing
the behavior of any creature - Lawful,
Neutral, or Chaotic.
Saving Throw: A creature’s chance to save
itself from a special attack (magic, poison, etc.).

Abbreviations

and earning more powerful characters,
and the DM has fun playing the monsters
and entertaining players.
For example, it’s not fair to change the
rules unless everyone agrees to the change.
When you add optional rules, apply them
evenly to everyone, players and monsters.
Do not make exceptions; stick to the rules,
and be fair.

The Most Important Rule
There is one rule which applies to everything you will do as a Dungeon Master. It is
the most important of all the rules! It is
simply this:
BE FAIR.
A Dungeon Master must not take sides.
You will play the roles of the creatures
encountered, but do so fairly, without
favoring the monsters or the characters.
Play the monsters as they would actually
behave, at least as you imagine them.
The players are not fighting the DM!
The characters may be fighting the monsters, but everyone is playing the game to
have fun. The players have fun exploring

2

A DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game is
basically a series of encounters, with other
actions (such as movement and problem
solving) between them. The dice are often
used to find results when choices must be
made. All the dice rolls are called “game
mechanics.” The game consists mostly of
role playing, game mechanics, and strategy.
During an Encounter, the players make
the Hit rolls, damage rolls, and Saving
Throws for their characters. You, the Dungeon Master, make similar rolls for the
monsters, plus other rolls to find the monsters’ actions (such as reactions and morale).

The DM’s Roles
You will play the roles of all the monsters,
townspeople, and other creatures encountered. The best Dungeon Masters are able
to play several roles at once - such as
when the characters meet another party of
adventurers, all played by the DM!
However, your creatures are not as detailed as the PCs, and are easier to play.
Their actions are often determined by dice
rolls. One rule applies to all the creatures,
even though there are many different
types: Imagine how the creature feels.
The actions of a creature are often determined by its Alignment or Intelligence.
For example, an animal is not very smart,
and will act very simply - hungry and
hostile, neutral and unconcerned, or
friendly. More intelligent creatures may be
thinking of many different things; food,
treasure, home and friends, and so forth.
When an encounter seems likely, think
about how the creatures feel, and how they
might act. When the encounter begins, you
will often roll dice to find the actual reactions of the creatures. The results should
be adjusted for the creatures’ intelligence,
habits, and other details.
Imagine how your creatures will react to
these dangerous, greedy characters stomping around the caves! The monsters will
try to survive and be happy in their own
ways, and will often fight to defend their
homes and treasures.

But remember - although the monsters
may be fighting the characters, you are not
fighting the players. If you try to entertain
them, they will entertain you. Play the roles
of the monsters, but forget them when
they are slain. Their only purpose, in the
long run, is entertainment.

Reactions
When an encounter begins, you may find
the actions of monsters by making Reaction rolls. The results are a guide to playing the monsters’ response to the arrival of
the characters.
An encountered creature might attack
automatically. The ghouls in your first
adventure, for example, will always attack
anyone entering their area, because the
description of this monster says so. Most
monsters do not always attack, so be sure to
read the descriptions carefully.
Many creatures can be friendly or unfriendly, depending on the situation. Their
reactions can sometimes be determined by
the actions of the characters. If a fighter
has a sword out and charges at a goblin,
the goblin is not going to think the fighter
is friendly! The goblin might attack and
might run away, but probably won’t try to
talk.
More often, however, the characters will
wait and “see what the monsters do” before
they start anything. Likewise, most monsters will usually wait to see how the characters act! When this type of encounter begins, you should make a Reaction Roll for
the monsters, using 2d6. Up to 3 Reaction
Rolls may be needed to finish the encounter.
Whenever the characters attack the
monsters, stop rolling for reactions. The
monsters will fight to defend themselves,
and might run away (depending on their
Morale score, as explained on page 14).
Reaction Rolls are explained in detail on
pages 22 - 23. Read that section before
starting your first group game.

Running the Game
During most of a D&D game, the Dungeon
Master leaves the decisions to the players.
The DM presents the setting - describing
what the characters see, offering choices of
actions, and so forth. But the course of the
game is determined by the actions of the
party, as decided by all the players. The
DM can almost relax and enjoy the characters’ progress as they explore, make maps,
solve puzzles, and so forth.
The DM usually deals with the characters as a group, rather than the individuals.
However, when an encounter begins, a
change occurs. The DM takes a more

active role, becoming more aware of the
actions of each character. The players have
a more limited choice of actions as they
confront a monster or NPC. The DM plays
the roles of each of the creatures encountered, and decides their actions while considering those of the characters. Game
time passes in “slow motion,” as the DM
carefully considers the round-by-round action (10 seconds at a time) and announces
the results.
An experienced Dungeon Master can
play the roles of several monsters at once.
It can be very hard to do this fairly, without
favoring the monsters or the characters.
Just as players should keep “player knowledge” and “character knowledge” separate,

so should the DM keep the “monster
knowledge” completely separated from the
“DM information.” This challenging task is
further complicated by the need to keep
the game running smoothly at the same
time!
The following checklists can be used to
make sure that everything is handled
smoothly during normal play (ORDER OF
EVENTS IN A GAME TURN), during an
encounter (ORDER OF EVENTS IN AN
ENCOUNTER), and during an encounter
that results in combat (ORDER OF
EVENTS IN COMBAT). You may concentrate on the roles of the monsters, using
these lists as reminders of the necessary
game mechanics.

Your first game
The following adventure is designed for
use by a beginning Dungeon Master. It will
tell you what to say to the players, when
and what to roll, and includes page references for additional information.
Before you start, you should look
through the rest of this booklet, to see what
information is given. One section called
“Procedures and Rules” (pages 14 - 21)
gives details on handling most situations.
Retainers should not be needed if there
are 4 or more players, but if you use them,
be sure they are properly handled (page
20). The Order of Events checklists will be
helpful during the game.
Monsters and treasures are explained
afterwards in separate sections. All the
details on the monsters and treasures
found in this adventure are fully explained
here, and you will not need to refer to
those sections.
Before you start the game, make sure all
the pre-game details have been handled,
using the Pre-game Checklist.
PRE-GAME CHECKLIST
1. Do all. the layers know how to play?
Have they rayed the Solo Adventure in
the PLAYAS’ MANUAL?
2. Have you read this book up to this point?
Have you looked through the rest of this
booklet?
3. Do you and the players know the “WhoWhy-What-Where-When” of the adventure?
4. Are all the characters ready to go, includin equipment?
5. Have &e players chosen a Caller and a
Mapper? Do they have a piece of graph
DaDer and a Dencil. to mav with?

If any answer is “No,” stop and fix the
problem.
In this adventure, you will find many
sections to be read to the players. Listen to
them while you are reading; they contain
information for you, too!
Whenever you find a paragraph that
starts with “DM:” it contains information
for you only. Stop for a minute and read it.
The DM Information contains instructions
on how to run the coming encounter, or
how to handle a new situation.
Adventure Record Sheet

Using a blank ptece of scrap paper, make a
list of the details you will need during the
adventure. Near the top of the page, write
the name of each Character, making a list.
To the right of each name, write the class
of the character. To the right of the class,
write the Armor Class of the character.
Ask the Caller for the party’s marching
order. The characters would normally
travel in single file or in pairs. Write the
marching order below the character list,

using initials, and note which end is the
front to avoid confusion.
The rest of the sheet may be used for
keeping track of time, the details of monsters encountered, treasure found, and any
other notes you wish to make.
When you are ready, turn the page and
start reading, following the instructions
given.

Find #1 on the map on this page; that is
the location of the characters at this point.
They have approached from the south
(from the bottom of the map), heading
north (towards the top of the page).
Assume that the walk from town took
about 1 hour, and that the time is now 8:OO

1 Read the following:

DM: Encourage the players to send someone forward to examine the door. They
should do so, to be sure their path will be
safe. If they don’t investigate now, a hidden monster could surprise the party as
they pass by. The following encounter is a
“warm-up” for both you and the players to
practice playing in a group.
Find out which characters are examining
the door closely, and which are keeping
watch for other dangers. Then read the
following:

DM: If the characters closely examining
the door, select a fighter or dwarf (if
possible), or randomly pick a character, to
be the victim of the coming attack. Do not
tell the layers what you have done!
Ask t e players, one by one and starting
with the victim you have chosen, what their
characters intend to do. Remember what
they say, and make notes if you wish. Then
read the following:

You will need the following details about
the monster. Copy them onto your adventure Record Sheet:

If the monster is put to sleep by a Sleep
spell, read #2. If the monster is killed,
read #3.
The carrion crawler will use all 8 of its
tentacles to attack the single victim you
have chosen. Tell that player to roll ld6 for
initiative, while you roll Id6 for the monster. If your roll is higher, make 8 Hit rolls

for the carrion crawler. If the player’s roll is
higher, allow the party to move or attack
first.
Be aware of the actions of the other
characters, but do not allow any of them to
attack in the first round unless they are
next to the victim. If any Missile Fire
attacks are desired, tell the players “You
must move around for a clear shot, to
avoid hitting your friends. You may fire
next round.”
If any of the carrion crawler’s attacks hit,
the character must make a Saving Throw
vs. Paralysis (one per hit) or be paralyzed.
If any Saving Throw is failed, tell the
victim “You fall over.” Tell the rest of the
players that they see the victim fall, but do
not say whether the character is alive or
dead.
After the first round of combat, ask each
player for actions for the coming round. If
the first victim is paralyzed, the monster
will attack the next closest character. If no
characters are nearby, it will crawl out of its
hole and attack the nearest.
If more than one character moves in to
attack the monster, the 8 attacks will be
divided among the two closest opponents.
Anyone hit must make a Saving Throw or
fall over, paralyzed.
Continue running the battle as long as
necessary. The party should be able to kill
the carrion crawler fairly easily. Any paralyzed characters will recover in 3 turns ($4
hour), unharmed. The party may wait in
the outer ruins (this area) while their
friends are recovering, or may drag them
out to the edge of the fields (an even safer
move). Whichever they choose, be sure to
keep track of the passage of game time,
counting the battle as 1 full turn.

DM: If the monster climbed out to attack
the party, skip to #4.Otherwise, continue:

DM: The huge door is too heavy to be
moved, and it would take hours to dig
another hole through the rubble. If the
characters cooperate, they can grasp the
body of the monster and pull it out of the
hole. Its tentacles are not dangerous after
death, and the creature may easily be
pulled out of the hole. Read #4.

4 Read the following:

DM: In the future, you should not remind
the players about traps. But in this “warmup encounter,” try to help them decide
what to do. There are no traps or other
unusual features to be found, but the
characters should always check.
A skeleton will be found at the bottom of
the hole, mostly covered by the treasure.
Close inspection will reveal that it is the
skeleton of a short man-like creature
whose head is smiliar to a dog’s. It does not
move, being merely an old skeleton of one
of the carrion crawler’s past victims. Read
the following:

2 The carrion crawler is put to sleep by a
magic-user or elf spell. When it goes to
sleep, it merely stops moving, and its tentacles slump to the ground. Any character
with a sword or dagger can kill the monster
with one blow, and without waking it up.
When the monster is killed, read #3.

DM: If the party decides to enter the hole
in the wall, read #lo. If they go to the
closed gateway, read #8. Mark off another
turn of time for discussion and some
movement, back to the outer ruins in front
of the wall.

8 DM: The party decides to go to the
closed doors at the front gate. When they
get there, they may try to open the doors,
but will have no success. Give them the
options listed in #5.
9 DM: If the characters did not look
through the holes in the wall, roll ld6. If
the result is 1-3, the kobolds gain surprise:
In the coming battle, each kobold will get
one free missile fire attack before the party
can act. If the result is 4-6, no free attacks
will occur, but the kobolds will attack anyway. Read #lo.
10 DM: The kobolds in the courtyard are
guards. They have been ordered to not let
anyone enter the ruin. Seeing the party,
they have closed the front gate, and will
hold it shut if the party tries to break in.
These kobold guards are the biggest in
their tribe, and have maximum hit points
(4 each). They are armed with short bows,
arrows, and short swords. Each kobold has
2 quivers of arrows (20 per quiver), so you
will not need to keep track of their equipment. A hit from a kobold arrow will inflict
1-6 points of damage, but the short sword
attack of these weak creatures causes only
1-4 points of damage. Use the “up to 1 Hit
Die” line of the Hit roll as chart, kobolds
6

are merely Yz Hit Die creatures. Each
kobold carries a small leather bag containing 3-18 cp, but no other treasure.
A Sleep spell cast at the kobolds will
automatically put them all to sleep. If this
occurs, stop (regardless of what is happening at the time) and read #16.
Read the following to the players:

DM: Find the planned actions of each
character, one by one. If they want to talk
about the situation, rounds of time will
pass, and the kobolds will keep firing. For
each minute of real time the players spend
talking, count off one round of game time,
and make one round of Hit rolls for the
kobolds! Treat any part of a minute as a
full round. The characters should take
cover before they start talking, and you
may remind them of this.
Missile fire is featured in this encounter.
The kobolds begin firing as the party
enters through the hole in the wall. The
battle could result in the following situations:
a. The characters respond with missile fire
of their own, and do not approach the
kobolds. Some characters may take
cover behind boulders. If this occurs,
read #12.
b. One or more characters move towards
the monsters, and are fired upon several times. If this occurs, read #13.
C. The characters move cautiously towards
the kobolds, using boulders for cover. If
this occurs, read #14.
d. One or more characters remain inside
the hole entrance, keeping the attention
of the kobolds while the others circle
around. If this is done, the kobolds will
be busy with missile fire, and the party
may break in. If this occurs, read #15.
e. The characters all go back out, circling
around to enter by the gateway. They
will still not be able to get in, and must
return to the hole in the wall (or go
home).

11 DM: The party attacks the kobolds
hand-tn-hand. If nnssihle. earh monster

You must carefully keep track of the
exact position of each character during this
encounter. As characters move, the missile
fire range will change. Characters in metal
armor move 20’ per round; in leather
armor, 30’ per round; unarmored, 40’ per
round.
When the party first enters, the kobolds
are hiding behind some rubble next to the
path inside the gateway. They are 110’
away from the party, so their first missile
fire attacks are at long range ( - 1 penalty
on each Hit roll). These attacks may be
aimed at any characters, either selected or
randomly determined.
During the first round of movement, the
approaching characters move into medium
range (no range adjustment). All the missile fire is aimed at the approaching characters. The kobolds ignore those characters taking cover.
Carefully keep track of both the positions of the characters and the passing of
each round of game time. Remember to
roll for initiative each round, to see if the
characters move before or after the
kobolds fire their arrows.
When any character gets within 20‘ of
the kobolds, all the monsters will drop
their bows and draw their swords. They
will all attack immediately; read #11.

Keep track of time! A character in metal
armor (moving 20’ per round) will take 6
rounds to get to the doors. During this
time, the kobolds will all keep firing at
their targets by the hole in the wall. If no
characters are firing back at them or moving toward them, 3 kobolds will stop firing
and hold the doors.
When characters try to break into the
front gate, roll ld6. Modify the result as
follows:
Subtract 1, because the doors are locked.
Add the Strength adjustment of the
strongest character forcing the door ( + 1
for 13-15 Strength, etc.).
Add 1 for each additional character
helping to force the door, whatever their
Strength scores (+ 1 for 2 characters forcing the doors, + 2 for 3 characters, etc.).
Subtract 3 if kobolds are holding the
doors closed.
If the adjusted total is 5 or 6, the doors
are broken open. If the total is 4 or less, the
doors hold fast. Characters may repeat the
attempt once per round.
If the doors are broken open, the characters may move in while the kobolds draw
their swords. No free attacks are gained by
either side. Read #I1 to run the hand-tohand combat.

Your first game
DM: Play the role of the kobold prisoner.
He will not say anything about the rest of
the dungeon, but will reveal that he is one
of the guards, placed here to prevent anyone from entering the ruins.
The kobold will offer to give money if
the party will let him (and any other surviving kobolds) go. He asks to be untied to
show the party where the treasure is. If the
party unties him, however, he will run for
the door to the ruined castle, and get away!
If the party insists on keeping a rope tied
to him, he will lead them to a pile of rubble
by the east tower ruin. After digging for a
minute, he will pull out a small iron box,
which is not locked. The box contains 100
gp and a black gem (onyx, worth 50 gp).
If the characters want to kill the kobold
after getting the treasure, remind the lawful characters that they would keep their
part of the bargain, and let the kobolds go.
If released, the kobolds will all leave peacefully. After thanking the party, they leave
by the front gate and run away to hide in
the mountains.
When all the kobolds are gone, read
#18.

18 Read the following:

DM: Now stop the game. Tell the players
about each of the possible strategies given
in #lo. You may either read each section to
the players, or play each one, as if it
actually happened! If you play them, treat
them as practice only. Remember what the
characters’ hit points and equipment are
now, so they can be returned to “normal”
after the practice.
When you are ready to continue the
game, read #19.

19 DM: To run the rest of this adventure,
use the following Encounter Key for descriptions of each area of the dungeon.
Keep track of the location of the party on
your map. When they approach a numbered location, find that number in the
key, and read the description.
Remember to keep track of time. The
party’s movement rate per turn is equal to
the movement rate of their slowest character (probably 60’ per turn).
Use the Order of Events checklists to be
sure you are running each turn and encounter properly. If you have any problems, remind the playefs that you are still
learning, find the explanation of the situation in this booklet, and read it.

Dungeon Level One
Notes for the DM
The first level of this dungeon may be used
for two or three group games. It was
designed using the guidelines given on
pages 46 - 47. Treasure is placed according to the frequency given. Of all the
rooms, ’/3 are empty, ‘/3 have monsters, ‘/6
have traps, and ‘/6 are “Specials.”
One room (#27) contains dangerous
monsters and a difficult situation, and
should not be entered by beginning characters (nor run by an inexperienced DM!).
Its doors are specially locked to prevent
first level characters from entering. When
any character reaches the 2nd level of
experience, the room may be entered.
The second level of the dungeon is left
for you to fill! A map is given, along with a
list of possible monsters. No Wandering
Monsters are encountered on Level One,
but they should now start appearing occasionally on levels 2 and 3. Dungeon level 3
is left entirely for you to create, and you
may add lower levels if you wish.
The characters should be able to leave
the dungeon at any time, whenever they
need rest and healing. Since the dungeon
is near to their home town, they should not
have to spend a night inside. Other dungeons may be so far away as to make the
return trip to town nearly useless. A brief
stay overnight in an unoccupied room may
allow spell casters to relearn their spells,
curing any badly wounded characters in
the morning. A dungeon may thus be
easily explored for a few days, or until a
full load of treasure is found.
Some standard features of this dungeon
(which may be told to the players) are:
All walls, ceilings, and floors are
made of stone.
All walls are 10‘ high (inside).
All areas are dark; characters must
carry light sources.
All room descriptions include the following information, in this order:
1. size, measuring north to south,
then east to west
2. exits
3. contents

Encounter Key:
Dungeon Level One
20 Entrance:
The path through the rubble leads from
the main gate to the doors of the castle
ruin. The walls of this castle are still firm,
8

and this is the only entrance. The doors
are not locked, and will open easily.
If anyone climbs the walls outside, they
will discover that the first floor of the castle
remains intact, but the upper stories have
fallen completely apart. The rubble in the
area is all that remains.
When the doors open, the characters see
the first room inside the castle. Read the
following to the players:

DM: As the party enters the room, sunlight
will brighten the area, but the rooms to the
sides will remain dark. Ask the characters
what their light sources are, and make
notes of which characters light torches or
lanterns. Everyone does not have to have
their own light source.
The party should search this area before
continuing, but nothing of interest remains.
The party can choose to go north, to the
next door, west to room 22, or east to room
23.

21 Wrong way:
DM: You should not be reading this to the
players. As the party approaches a numbered area on the map, find that number
in this Encounter Key and use the information given. There is no #21 on the map.
Look carefully at the map, find the party’s
location, and turn to that number.

22 West hall:
This 30’ x 30’ room has doorways in the
east and west walls. It contains the remains
of 3 chairs and 2 small tables. A fireplace is
in the middle of the north wall.
If they search carefully, the characters
will find 3 old silver teaspoons, worth 10 sp
each, and a small ba of dried-up peas.
If they search the ireplace, they will see
that the chimney is clogged with old timbers. If they search the chimney, read the
following:

The movement rate given is only for flying. The bat flies out and attacks the
character disturbing it. If the bat is hit, roll
2d6 to check morale; if the result is 7 or
less, the bat will fly off through the west
doorway, landing on a chest in room 28. If
an 8 or more is rolled, the bat will fight to
its death.
One of the pieces of rubble shaken loose
by the bat is an onyx gem, worth 50 gp.
However, it will not be found unless characters examine the fresh rubble carefully.

23 Hallway:
This 30’ x 20‘ area has doorways (without
doors) in the east and west walls. Normal
wooden doors are in the north and south
walls. The room contains some trash but
nothing of interest.

24 East hall:
This 30’ x 30’ room has empty doorways
in the east and west walls, and the doors
are missing. A fireplace is in the north wall,
and the room contains the remains of 4
chairs and one small table.
An old pillow stuffed with feathers will
be found if the characters search the room.
There is also one loose brick inside the
chimney of the fireplace. However, the
chimney is filled with old fallen timbers. If
a character searches the chimney, some
timbers fall, and a Saving Throw vs. Wands
must be made. If failed, the character takes
2-5 points of damage from falling timbers;
if successful, 1 point of damage is still
inflicted. The loose brick is automatically
found while the chimney is searched. A
finely made silver dagger is hidden in a
niche behind the loose brick. It is not
magical, but may be sold in town for 75 gp.

25 Bedroom:

Somehow, the moldy bed looks very
comfortable. The first two characters to
enter the room must each make a Saving
Throw vs. Spells! If successful, nothing
happens, but if failed, the victim(s) will
walk over to the bed, lie down, and take a
nap. The victim may sleep for years, but
will not age nor need food or drink.
A victim can only be awakened from this
magical sleep in one of three ways:
A Dispel Magic spell will remove the
enchantment (available in town for a
price).
A normal pea placed under the mattress
will cause the victim to awaken immediately, but with a sore back ( - 2 on all Hit
rolls until a good night’s rest is had).
If placed on the bed in room 26, the
victim will wake. Tickling the victim (with a
feather, for example) has no effect. The
room contains nothing else of interest.

26 Bedroom:
This room looks exactly the same as room
25, but with two doorways in the east wall
and one to the west. The bed is completely
harmless, and even helpful. If a sleeping
victim of the bed in room 25 is placed on
this bed, the victim will wake in 3 minutes,
completely unharmed by the experience
and refreshed by the nap.
If the victim is tickled while on the bed
(with a feather, for example), the entire
bed will magically sneeze. This sneeze will
cause the mold in the room to fly into the
air, and everyone in the room must make a
Saving Throw vs. Spells or start sneezing
themselves, unable to do anything else!
This sneezing lasts for 4 rounds, and attracts the monsters in room 35, which
arrive 1 round after the sneezing starts.
The monsters and the sleeping victim are
not affected by the mold.
This bed may also be used to cure the
deadly choking effect of yellow mold (see
room 27).
,

27 Dining hall:
Special Note: The doors to this room can
only be opened by a character of 2nd Level
or greater. You should read this entire
encounter description before starting to run
it. When you are ready, read the following
to the players:

This room is 30’ x 40‘,with two empty
doorways in the west wall and one in the
east wall. The doors are missing. A large
fireplace is in the south wall.
This area was once a fine bedroom, but
its once-rich furnishings - the canopy
bed, plush chairs, tables and rugs - are
now tattered, moldy, and worthless.

These horrible creatures are feared by the
kobolds and all other creatures in the area,
and are avoided. They, in turn, stay in this
room, feasting on the victims who wander
in. The skeletons are all that remain of
their past meals.
When any door is opened, the harpies
start singing a duet. Every character must
make a Saving Throw vs. Spells. The song
of the harpies is enchanting; if the Saving
Throw is failed, the victim is Charmed
(fully explained on page 23), and hears
beautiful music.
If the door is closed immediately, the
characters will be able to drag their
Charmed comrades away from the room.
The Charm may be removed by a Dispel
Magic spell (available in town, for 100 gp),
or by placing the victim on the bed in room
25 (causing sleep) and then on the bed in
room 26 (waking the victim and removing
the Charm).
If the door is not closed, the victim will
walk into the room, circle the table, and
continue toward the fireplace. If the Saving Throw is successful, the harpies’ song is
heard to be screeching noise, and has no
effect. Only one Saving Throw must be
made for the song of the two harpies.

Your first game
If a cleric tries to Turn the skeletons,
make the rolls normally, but there will be
no effect. The skeletons are not animated
monsters.
If any character attacks the harpies, the
monsters will fly around the room and
over the table, avoiding combat as much as
possible. They will not land on or disturb
the table, however. If cornered by two or
more characters, a harpy will fi ht.
If any character touches a gofd plate or
climbs onto the table to attack the flying
harpies, a terrible thing may occur. The
“gold” plates are actually tin, covered with

The harpies’ treasure box contains: a

and two potions of healing. In addition,
the 12 sets of silverware on the table are
worth 5 gp per set. The goblets are only
worth 1 gp for all 12, and will probably
crack on the journey to town. The tin
plates are corroded and worthless.

These molds are smaller than normal. For
each plate touched, roll ld6; if the result is
1-3, the mold releases a small cloud of
spores, catching only the character disturbing the plate. The victim takes 1-4 points of
damage and must make a Saving Throw
vs. Poison or start choking, unable to do
anything else. A choking victim will die in 6
rounds unless taken to, and placed in, the
bed in room 26.
Anyone climbing onto the table will disturb 2 plates, which may both produce
clouds of spores (roll for each), inflicting
1-4 points for each cloud but only requiring a single Saving Throw.
Yellow mold can only be harmed by fire.
The touch of a torch wiU automatically destroy the mold on one plate, but a roll must
be made for each such touch to determine
whether a spore cloud is released.
If one harpy is killed, roll 2d6 to check
the morale of the other. If the total is 6 or
less, it will surrender, offering to give all its
treasure to the party in exchange for its
freedom. If the party accepts, it will pull a
long flat chest out from under the table.
The chest is locked, but the harpy has a
key. It will open the lock and the chest, and
then leave (if the characters permit) by the
door in the south wall, continuing outside
to flee into the mountains.
If questioned after it surrenders, the
harpy will tell of a magic-user who came
one day and took charge of the dungeon.
This man lives below, on a lower level of
the dungeon, and the kobolds serve him.
If the harpies are slain, a search of the
room will reveal the harpies’chest. The key

DM: All the boxes are covered with a thick
layer of dust, and have not been disturbed
for a long time. None of the boxes can be
moved, opened, or damaged in any way!
If the searching characters tap on any
box, a deep voice will come from a larger
one in a corner, saying: “Who’s there?”
Whatever the characters say, it will respond
with “Is Bargle with you?”Again, whatever
the characters say, it will finish with “Oh well then, never mind!” It will not speak
again.

29 Closet:
This small 10’ x 30’ room has doorways in
the south and east walls, but no doors. A
dusty old round hatbox is lying on the
floor in the northwest corner.
The hatbox is tied with a string. If the
string is cut, the hatbox can be opened
safely. But if the large bow knot on top of
the box is untied, the character untying it
must make a Saving Throw vs. Poison or
take 1-6 points of damage, from poison
placed on the string.
A woman’s red hat, now faded and
moldy, is in the box. The hat itself is
worthless, but if removed from the box, a
hatpin will be found beneath it. The hatpin
is solid platinum, and worth 100 gp.

30 Stairs:
This 20‘ x 30’ room has doorways in the
north and east walls, but no doors. A
stairway by the south wall leads down to
Dungeon Level 2. There is a fireplace in
the northwest corner of the room. Lurking
on the stairway are 4 kobolds, who are

they will want payment of at least 10 gp to

Each kobold has a bag containing 5 cp,

31 TrapRoom:
This room is 30‘ x 30‘, with doorways in
the south and east walls (but no doors).
A large log is in the center of the room.
One end is on the floor, but the other end
is held up by a strong rope, which runs
through hooks in the ceiling, wall, and
floor. It is tied to a large chest, which is on
the floor directly below the upraised log.
If the rope is cut, the log falls, smashing
the chest and scattering its contents.
The lid of the chest is not held shut by
the rope, and can be opened easily. It is not
trapped. Inside the chest are 500 sp, 50 gp,
and one citrine gem (value 10 gp).
The kobolds and other monsters in the
dungeon have avoided this area, believing
it to be a deadly trap. It is harmless unless
the rope is cut.

32 Statueroom:
This room is 20’ x 20’, with a normal door
in the east wall and a doorway (without
door) in the west wall.
In the center of the room stands a statue
of a short dog-headed man, clad in leather
armor and apparently swinging a short
sword (a kobold).
If the statue is touched, the center portion of the statue (from chin to waist) spins
in a complete circle. The stone sword will
hit the character touching the statue unless
a Saving Throw vs. Wands is made, but
with a penalty of -2 to the roll. If failed,
the character is hit for 2-8 points of
damage; if successful, the character jumps
out of the way in time.

Your first game
This trap may be made harmless if a
small button on the belt buckle of the
statue is pushed. This button will not be
found, however, except by a thief’s search
(normal Find Traps roll). Once the button
is found, the thief may automatically “remove” the trap by pushing the button; no
Remove Traps roll is made.

33 Closet:
This small room is 10‘ x 20‘, and has only
one entrance, the normal door on the east
wall. The room contains piles of rags and
trash. Hiding in the pile are 4 giant rats,’
which will attack if the room is entered.

identical to room 28, filled with boxes of all
shapes and sizes. These boxes, however,
can be moved and opened, but they are all
empty. All, that is, except for one, a large
box at the bottom of one pile. Inside the
box is a zombie, which will stand and attack
with a sword if the box is opened. It

END OF DUNGEON LEVEL 1

Dungeon Level Two
General Notes:
The map of this level is given, see inside
front cover, but is left for you to fill with
monsters and treasures, using the guidelines given on page 47. The following
monsters may be included:
1 kobold lair (20-40 with chieftain, divided among 4-10 rooms)
1 Crab Spider lair (avoided by the
kobolds)
Beetles and Centipedes
Rats (Normal and Giant)

Wandering monsters may include:
Kobolds
Beetles and Centipedes
Gelatinous Cube
Undead (skeletons, zombies, ghouls)

Dungeon Level Three
This area is left entirely for you to design.
It should include the lair of Bargle (Chaotic magic-user Level 5-7) and his guards
(Charmed ogres), plus his wandering decoys (Living Crystal Statues dressed like
Bargle), and possibly some Dopplegangers
as well.
You may also include a small tunne!
leading to a large cavern, the lair of a small
dragon. Such a cavern should have a large
exit leading outside in the nearby mountains, and the dragon should not be part of
the “normal” dungeon. You may make this
cavern known to Bargle, and the dragon
might be a friend of his. The cavern could
provide an escape route for Bargle if the
party is conquering the dungeon.

Ending an adventure
Before any game begins, the DM and
players should set a time for the game to
end - and stick to it. An adventure might
end before that time (if the characters
become severely wounded, use up all their
spells, are fully loaded with treasure, etc.).
They may be allowed to “go home, rest a
day or two, and return” if time permits
further adventuring.
At the end of an adventure, you announce the total treasure found (and kept)
by the party, so the players can divide it.
The method of division should have been
decided before the adventure began. Some
methods are described in the PLAYERS
MANUAL, on page 55.
While the players are dividing treasure,
you may spend the time calculating the
Experience Points earned during the adventure. An electronic pocket calculator is
helpful.
You should have records of all the creatures defeated by the party on an adventure Record Sheet. If not, take a few
minutes to remember the creatures encountered. If necessary, ask the players to
remind you - and remember to keep a
record next time.
In each monster description, an “XP
value” is given. This is the number of
Experience Points to be awarded for each
monster of that type. Multiply the XP
value by the number of monsters defeated
to find the total XP award for that encounter. Note that a captured monster is
counted as “conquered” for XP awards,
even if released. This does not occur often;
the monster must usually surrender (as the
result of a morale check) or be magically
caught (by a Hold Person or Web spell, for
example) for this situation to arise. Monsters that run away are not counted unless
they are caught or defeated later.
Add all the XP awards for all the encounters to find the total XP for the adventure. Find the number of shares in the
party. NPC retainers count as $4 share for
XP division; each character counts as a full
share. Finally, divide the total XP by the
number of shares to find the XP per share,
and announce that total. A retainer will get
’/2 the amount you announce.
Remind the players to adjust that award
for high or low Prime Requisites ( + 5 % ,
+IO%, or a penalty). They may ask you to
help calculate it. You should also remind
them that they get 1 XP for each 1 gp of
treasure. As treasure is divided by the
party, without your interference, they must
make such calculations themselves. Their
bonus or penalty (for high or low PR score)
also applies.

as a result of the XP earned in an adventure, you should watch the roll made for
additional hit points. If the character is a
magic-user or elf, you should privately tell
the player what additional spell is put into
their spell book. If the character is a thief,
remind the player to change the Percentage chances for the special abilities (PLAYERS’ MANUAL, page 44).
A character cannot gain more than one
level of experience in one adventure. Beware if this occurs; it is a sign that you are
giving out far too much treasure. If it does
occur, some XP should not be counted!
The character’s XP total stops just short of
the amount needed for the second level of
experience that would have been gained.

XP for Monsters
The Experience Points for Monsters
Table may be used to calculate the XP
awards for monsters created by the DM, or
for variations of the given monsters. The
XP awards in the monster descriptions are
calculated using this chart. The Special
Ability bonus is multiplied by the number
of asterisks given with the monster’s Hit
Dice, and added to the Base XP value.

Alignment Changes
Alignment is the way a player wants to play
a character, either Lawful, Neutral, or
Chaotic. Sometimes a player forgets (or
ignores) the alignment of his character,
and plays the adventurer incorrectly. You
should talk privately with the player about
the problem, and encourage the proper
play of alignment. Never threaton or tease
a player during a game; deal with the
problem in private.
If the problem continues after you have
warned the player more than once, you
may tell the player to change the alignment
of the character to the different alignment
actually being played. A penalty may be
applied at this time, such as the loss of one
level of experience, a valued item, etc.
If you penalize alignment changes, you
should also reward good alignment play
(for example), by increasing experience
awarded, treasures or changing monsters
to make them easier to defeat.
Be sure that you are playing the alignments of monsters correctly! The players

may respond to unfairness by refusing to
play in your game.
If a change of alignment occurs due to
the effects of a magic item (such as a Helm
of Alignment Changing, or a curse), no
penalty should be applied. Take the player
aside and explain the situation. A good
player will cooperate, playing the new
alignment well, resulting in more fun for
all. The original alignment should return
after a period of time (after the curse or
Helm is removed).

Arguments
If an argument starts during a game, stop
the game for a moment. Listen to both
sides, and make a decision. Then continue
the game as soon as possible. Do not allow
an argument to continue for long. Explain
that everyone is trying to have fun, and
that the argument can be settled after the
game if necessary.

Charm Person Spells
Whenever a magic-user or elf casts a
Charm Person spell, the player will ask you
for the effect. This spell will only affect
certain creatures. The beginning player
will try it on many different monsters, and
learn its effects by trial and error.
Generally, the creatures affected by a
Charm Person spell are those which are
“normal” human, demi-human, or humanlike creatures, which have some sort of
society. You may decide the exact creatures
affected, or you may use the list below.
Once a victim fails the Saving Throw
against the Charm, the creature will remain Charmed for at least 24 hours, and
often longer. The victim may make a new
Saving Throw to break the Charm after a
given duration. This duration is determined by the victim’s intelligence:

High intelligence:
Average intelligence:
Low intelligence:

1 day
1 week
1 month

l-

If you wish to make your own list, the
creatures which should not be affected by
this spell are
(a) animals
(b) undead
(c) any creatures with 6 or more Hit
Dice
14

(d) fantastic creatures (such as gargoyle,
medusa, thoul, etc.)
The human-like creatures in this set
which are subject to Charm Person are:
High Intelligence: pixie, sprite.
Average Intelligence: gnome, goblin,
hobgoblin, kobold, troglodyte.
Low Intelligence: bugbear, gnoll, lizard
man, neanderthal, ogre, orc.
Humans (including Bandits, Berserkers,
and Normal Humans) and demi-humans
(dwarves, elves, and halflings) may have
Low, Average, or High Intelligence. If the
exact score has not been determined, you
may select or roll for an Intelligence score.
Elves always have Average Intelligence or
better, and magic-users normally have
High Intelligence. A score of 3-8 is Low,
9-12 is Average, and 13-18 is High.
Some lycanthropes can be Charmed
when in human form, but this is nearly
useless. Only werewolves and wereboars
can be Charmed, and the Charm will automatically be broken when the creature
assumes animal form!

NOTE: Some other creatures given in the
EXPERT and COMPANION Sets may also
be Charmed. They are listed in each set.

Clues
Beginning players often need help in
learning to play. When running a game for
beginners, the DM should encourage them
by saying such things as “Do you want to
search for secret doors?” or other suggestions. This should not be continued once
the players have experience with the game,
but such clues can be very helpful to
beginners.
You may wish to allow some “automatic
success” situations to encourage the players. Those who never find secret doors will
soon stop looking for them.
When the players gain experience with
the game, they may start asking questions
like “Do we find any traces of passing
creatures?” or “We don’t know which way
to go from here. Are there are clues?”You
may offer descriptive information that
players will have to determine what it
means. For example, “some footprints lead
off to the left, but you’re not sure what
made them.” Such clues may help to steer
the party in the right direction within a
dungeon. You may insert clues as part of
the room descriptions.

Procedures and rules
Clues should be given when the party is
approaching a deadly area, especially on
the first or second level of a dungeon.
Clues, such as, awful smells or bones of
earlier victims. Extreme danger with no
warning is not very fair.
Higher level characters are more accustomed to great dangers, and deeper dungeon levels may indeed contain suddendeath situations. Vague or misleading clues
may be provided by treasure maps found
or purchased, or by slight hard-to-find
indications in the dungeon areas. In general, when the players become more experienced, the clues may become fewer and
more subtle.

Complaints
If a player complains about the way you
are handling something in the game, try to
listen to the objection. Be reasonable! If
the problem can be fixed by changing a
procedure, try to work out a reasonable
compromise. For example, if a player says
“You keep killing characters with poison!”,
you might try using the optional damage
system for poison (page 24).
Be careful not to change rules that could
overbalance the game in favor of the characters. The game system is carefully balanced to provide fun for all while challenging the characters.
Some complaints may be caused by
greed. It should not be too easy to get
treasure or experience; these things should
be earned slowly, using the guidelines
given. Beware of the “giveaway game”!
Your players may quickly become bored
with easy riches, and their characters will
easily overpower most monsters.
If you are not sure how to handle a
situation,just tell the players! Everyone has
to learn, and learning a game like this can
be a slow process. Your players will understand if you explain that you made a
mistake. When you admit your mistakes
and try to correct them, you and your
players will have a better game in the long
run.

Creating Characters
When a newly created character has all low
scores, the player should discard it unless youI the DM, say that it should be
kept.
You should allow beginning players to
use characters they like! It’s hard to have
fun playing when you are forced to use a
poor character, with no score above 9 or
two scores below 6. If the character is
reasonable, then the player should keep
the character.

If a player wants a certain Class of
character but rolls another type, you may
allow a switch. Just switch the scores of the
Prime Requisite for the desired Class with
the Prime Requisite for the rolled Class. For
example, a fighter is rolled, with 17 Strength
and 9 Intelligence, but the player wants to
have a magic-user. Just put the 9 in
Strength, and the 17 in Intelligence.
Switching more than once should not be
allowed. And players are not allowed to
decide; only a DM may switch Ability
Scores.

realize that there is nothing there to find.
But if you roll -and possibly say the same
things! - the players realize that the item
might be there, still undiscovered.

Dwarves
Because of their mining experience,
dwarves can sometimes recognize special
dungeon features made of stone or wood,
such as
(1) sloping passages
(2) shifting walls
(3) new constructions
(4)traps
The traps a dwarf can find are those
involving large dungeon features, such as a
falling ceiling, floor pit, and so forth. The
traps a dwarf may discover does not refer
to all traps. For example, a dwarf would have
no chance at detecting a small dart trap on
a chest; this could be detectable only by a
thief.
Roll ld6. If the result of the roll is 1 or 2,
the attempt is successful - if there is
anything there to find. The attempt takes
about 1 turn per area (up to about a 30’ x
30‘ area, or the DMs choice). You may
wish to change this to less or more time. If
the player says “I’ll check for all those
dwarven things,” remind the player that it
will take 4 turns (1 for each of the 4
abilities), and ask the party if they want to
do anything while the dwarf is searching.
You may change this to 1 turn for all 4
abilities if in a smaller area or single room.

Deities
You may choose to add flavor to your
games by adding mythological deities. The
characters would be followers of such
beings, and a cleric could serve a specific
deity. However, all such activities are assumed, and should not influence play or
change the rules in any way. No deity
would react to the actions of any individual
character, nor offer any special help.
The deities of the game characters may
be similar to the mythological gods and
goddesses of days long past. The ancient
Greeks, for example, worshipped many
gods - Zeus, Apollo, Poseidon, and so
forth. According to legend, these gods
would grant favors to their worshippers,
and that is one way to explain the magic
spells a cleric character can cast in the
game.
The DM should be careful not to needlessly offend players, and current beliefs
should be avoided.

Elves

Demi-Humans

An elf character has a special skill at finding secret and hidden doors. This is because elves have very keen sight. They
have become more skilled at finding hidden things than are other characters.
The search for a secret door takes about
1 turn for each 10’ long section of wall (or
floor or ceiling) being searched. An elf
discovers a secret door on a roll of 1 or 2 on
ld6. If the player says ‘‘I’llsearch the room
for secret doors,” figure out the total
amount of time needed to search all the
room, and tell the player. The rest of the
party may wish to do other things while the
elf is searching.

All the demi-human classes have special
abilities. When the player wants the character to use one of these abilities, you will be
asked for the result.
Whenever the character is searching for
something, the player must describe the
exact area being searched. Each search
takes about 1 turn. If a player says “My
Character is looking for . . .” and names
one of the special abilities, roll ld6. You
should always roll, whether the item is
actually there or not. If you merely reply
“You don’t find anything,” the players will

Halflings
A halfling character has special skills at
hiding. This is because of the halfling’s
small size and ability to “freeze,” or hold
very still, not moving, for short periods of
time. A halfling is also harder to hit when
attacked by any creature larger than mansized.

Hiding
If a player says “My halfling will hide,” you
should roll to see if the attempt is successful. If outdoors, roll ld10. If the result is
1-9, the attempt is successful. Only a roll of
0 (IO) will indicate failure to “freeze” properly. The attempt at hiding assumes that
the character has crawled into some nearby
underbrush, and is not merely standing
somewhere.
In a dungeon, a halfling may attempt to
hide if some cover or shadow is nearby.
Cover could be furniture (table, barrel,
etc.), a nearby corner or large niche, or
even another character (if the other character cooperates and does not move). If a
halfling tries to hide within a dungeon, roll
ld6. The attempt is successful if the result
is 1 or 2.
A halfling trying to hide will always
believe that he has succeeded, but only the
DM knows for sure. Failure to hide might
be revealed when a monster suddenly attacks. If a monster sees a halfling and
approaches the character, you may say “It
seems to be coming right at you!” or something similar.

Dodging
In combat against creatures larger than
man-sized, halflings gain a bonus to their
Armor Class. Due to their small size and
skill at dodging, remember to penalize all
attacks from creatures larger than mansize by - 1. You may wish to ask the player
to remind you each time.

Dice
The dice included in this set are all you
need to play DUNGEONS & DRAGONS@
games. Whenever two or more events
could occur and a decision is needed, or
whenever a variety of results is possible,
dice may be used to randomly select a
result. Experienced Dungeon Masters may
select results instead of rolling dice.

Ranges (low and high numbers, such as
1-6 and 2-20) are given throughout this
booklet, most common in the MONSTERS
and TREASURES sections. The DM may
select any number given in the range for
Number Appearing, Damage, and so
forth, depending on the situation. The
dice to roll for a random result may be
easily calculated from the given range.
Some guidelines are:
1. If the first number is one, the second
gives the type of die to roll. Examples:
1-8 = ld8. 1-100 = d%.
2. If the first number is two, two dice are
(usually) used. If you divide the second
number in half, the type of dice is given.
Examples: 2-8 = 2d4; 2-12 = 2d6;
2-24 = 2d12.
3. If the first number is more than two, it
may indicate the number of dice, by the
method given above.
4 . If these methods do not identify the
type and number of dice, subtract 1 or
more from each number. T h e remainder will be a simple dice range.
Examples: The range 3-13 is 1 more
than 2-12, so 3-13 = 2d6+1. 5-10 =
ld6+4; 4-10 = 2d4+2.
With a little practice, you will quickly
learn the combinations of dice for the
given ranges.

Doors
Doors are common in most dungeons.
Many doors are locked, and most doors are
stuck. If locked, a door cannot be opened
until a thief unlocks it or until a magic-user
casts a Knock spell upon it. Any unlocked
door can be easily opened by any monster.
After a door is opened, it will usually slowly
swing shut unless a spike is used to wedge
the door open or it is held open.

Forcing Open Doors
If not locked, a stuck door can be forced
open by any character. If a player says “I’ll
open the door,” roll ld6. If the result is 5 or
6, the door is successfully forced open.
This roll should be modified by a character’s Strength score adjustment, but a roll
of 6 should always open a stuck door.
The attempt may be made once per
round per character. However, if the first
attempt fails, any monsters on the other
side of the door cannot be surprised, having heard the noise.
16

Secret Doors
Any character may search for secret doors.
The player must describe the exact area
being searched. This takes about 1 turn for
each 10‘ x 10’ area searched. If a player
says “My character will look for secret
doors,” roll ld6. You should always roll,
whether a secret door is there or not, to
keep the players guessing. If there is a
secret door and the result is a 1, the secret
door has been found. Elves find secret
doors with a roll of 1 or 2. Once a secret
door has been found and its exact location
noted on a map, anyone reading that map
can find the secret door later (no roll
necessary). A secret or hidden door may
not be opened until it has been found.

Special Doors
Some doors may be made to open only in
one direction. Such doors may not be
forced open from the wrong side, but will
open normally if a Knock spell is used
(from either side).

Equipment Not Listed
Beginning players should not be allowed to
purchase equipment other than the items
given on the list (PLAYERS MANUAL,
page 29) unless you decide otherwise. Allowing “invented” equipment can lead to
problems, and should be avoided.
In the D&D EXPERT rules, the players
have many more items to choose from,
including wagons, horses, boats, and more
weapons. But those items should not be
allowed until you and the players are ready
for them.

Evasion and Pursuit
Monsters may try to run away from the
characters, as determined by a morale check
(page 19) or the DM’s decision. The characters may try to run away from the monsters, a decision left to the players.
When characters are either fleeing or
chasing, no mapping is possible. The DM
should keep careful track of where the
characters and monsters are each round.
Unmapped areas may be described very
generally, without accurate measurements.
It is quite possible for the characters to
become lost, or to encounter other creatures during the pursuit.

Monsters Flee
When the monsters first start to run away,
ask the characters whether they want to
pursue. If the answer is no, the monsters
get away. If yes, the chase begins with the
monsters 1 round ahead of the party.

Procedures and rules
Find the monsters’ movement rate per
round to find the number of feet between
the groups at the start of the pursuit.
Next, compare the movement rates of
the individual characters. Unarmored
characters will move faster than the others.
In this case, you should ask the players
whether they want their characters to stay
with the party or to continue ahead of the
rest.
Compare the movement rates of the
fastest party members (or, if the party stays
together, the rate of the slowest character)
to the movement rate of the fleeing monsters. If the monsters are faster, they will
get away, unless trapped or stopped in
some way. If the characters are faster, they
will catch up to the monsters unless the
monsters evade. The difference in movement rates is the number of feet the pursuing characters gain, per round, on the
fleeing monsters.
The fleeing monsters may stop to fight if
they see only one or two characters in
pursuit (though the others may arrive
shortly thereafter). You may simply decide,
based on the situation, or make a reaction
roll to determine the monsters’ actions.
If the monsters are familiar with the
area (have a lair nearby), they may be able
to evade the party by rapidly turning corners, closing doors behind them, and so
forth. The DM must decide whether the
evasion is successful, as determined by the
situation.

Characters Flee
If the party runs away from the monsters,
the monsters may decide to pursue them.
Make a reaction roll (2d6), adjusting the
roll as follows:
-2 if any monsters have been slain.
+ 2 if no monsters have been hit.
+ 3 if the monsters are hunting the
characters.
No adjustment if any monster has been
hit but not slain.
If the adjusted result is 9 or greater, the
monsters will pursue. Compare the movement rates of each group. The characters
have a one-round “head start,” as described under “Monsters Flee.”
If the party is faster, they automatically
evade the monsters unless they are
stopped or trapped (or unless they stop too
soon; see Length of Pursuit, below). If the
monsters are faster, they will catch the
party.

terest the monsters. Unintelligent monsters may stop to eat dropped food, and
intelligent monsters may stop to pick up
dropped treasure. If any character drops
something which could cause the pursuing
monsters to stop, roll ld6. The monsters
will stop, and give up pursuit, if the result
is 1, 2, or 3.
Mindless or magical creatures, such as
Undead, Living Statues, and so forth, do
not stop to pick up anything, and might
pursue characters for a very long time.

Length of Pursuit
If nothing is dropped to cause them to
stop, monsters will pursue for any length
of time, as determined by further reaction
checks. After each 5 rounds of pursuit, roll
2d6 and apply the same adjustments for
wounds as originally made ( - 2,0, or 2).
In addition, add + 2 if the number of
monsters is greater than the number of
characters. If the adjusted result is 9 or
greater, the monsters will continue to pursue (or search for) the characters. However, monsters will usually give up pursuit
after 1-2 hours if the party has not been
found, and will rarely continue searching
longer than a day (8 hours) unless some
valuable item was stolen by the characters.

Higher Level Spells
The following spells are only for the DMs
use when developing NPCs of an experience level higher than 3rd. The spells
given are not the only spells of these
higher levels. A full list of higher level
spells is given in the D&D EXPERT SET.
For now, the DM should use these as the
only higher level spells available to NPCs.
Higher level spell casters will never go
on adventures with player characters. They
may be encountered as part of an NPC
party, but make very dangerous enemies,
and should rarely be used.
These spells might also be found on
magical scrolls (treasure). The DM should
be very careful when allowing this, as lower
level characters should not become as
powerful as these spells permit.

HIGH LEVEL CLERICS

Explanation of
Second Level Clerical Spells
bless*
Range: Touch
Duration: 6 turns
Effect: All friends within 60’
This spell raises the morale of all friendly
creatures in range by + I , and gives a
bonus of + 1 to all their Hit and Damage
rolls. It only affects those not yet in battle.

Hold Person
Range: 180’
Duration: 9 turns
Effect: 1-4 persons (cleric’s choice)
This spell will affect any human, demihuman or human-like creature (such as
bugbears, gnolls, gnomes, hobgoblins,
kobolds, lizard men, ogres, orcs, pixies or
sprites). It will not affect undead nor creatures of 5 Hit Dice or more. The victim(s)
must make a Saving Throw vs. Spells or be
paralyzed.
This spell may be cast either at a single
creature or at a group. If cast at a single
creature, that victim must make a Saving
Throw vs. Spells with a -2 penalty to the
die roll. If cast at a group, it may affect up
to 4 creatures, but no penalties apply to the
Saving Throws.

Silence 15’ Radius
Range: 180’
Duration: 12 turns
Effect: A spherical volume 30’ across
This spell will make the given area totally
quiet. Conversation and spells in this area
will be prevented for the duration of the
spell. This spell does not prevent a person
within the area from hearing noises made
outside the area. If cast at a creature, the
victim must make a Saving Throw VS.
Spells, or the silence will move along with
the victim! If the Saving Throw is successful, the spell will remain in the area to
which it was cast, and the intended victim
may move away from it.

Dispel Magic
Fire Ball
Flv

Procedures and rules
Dispel Magic
Range: 120’
Duration: permanent
Effect: A volume 20’ x 20’ x 20’
This spell will automatically destroy other
spell effects within the given volume. It
cannot affect magic items, but will remove
any spell effect created by a magic-user, elf,
or cleric of a level equal to lower than the
spell caster. It may fail to remove magical
effects created by a higher level caster. This
chance of failure is 5% per level of difference between the spell casters. A monster’s level is its Hit Dice, ignoring any
“plusses.”For example, a 5th level elf trying
to dispel a Charm Person cast by a 7th level
magic-user has a 10% chance of failure.

Fire Ball
Range: 240‘
Duration: instantaneous
Effect: A spherical volume 40’ across
This spell creates a missile of fire which
explodes into a ball of fire of 20’ radius
when it reaches the desired range or strikes
a target. The Fire Ball inflicts 1-6 (ld6)
points of fire damage for each level of the
spell caster. Each victim within the area of
effect takes full damage unless a Saving
Throw vs. Spells is made. Even if the
Saving Throw is successful, the victims take
half the rolled damage. For example, a Fire
Ball cast by a 6th level magic-user explodes
for 6-36 (6d6) points of damage. If the
total roll is 24, all within the area who make
their Saving Throws take 12 points of fire
damage.

Fly

Range: Touch
Duration: Id6 turns + 1 turn per level of
the spell caster
Effect: Any one living creature

This spell allows the caster (or a person
touched) to fly. The spell will permit movement in any direction and at any speed up
to 120‘ per round. It will also allow the
person to stop at any point (as a Levitate
spell). The person the spell is cast on has
control over the flying. The exact duration
is not known to anyone but the Dungeon
Master. For example, a 5th level elf may fly,
using this spell, for 6-11 (ld6 + 5) turns.

Hit Points
A player who rolls a low number of hit
points for a beginning character may ask
“Can I roll again?”
There are three possible answers. Whatever system you use, apply it to all the
players fairly.

No - all characters must start with the
hit points rolled.
If the result was 1 or 2, roll again. (You
might choose not to apply this to magicusers or thieves, who would roll 1-2
more often than others, as they use
ld4.)
Don’t roll - all characters start with
maximum hit points for their class, plus
Constitution bonus, if any. (A fighter or
dwarf starts with 8, a thief and magicuser with 4, others with 6 hp.) Roll for
hit points normally starting with 2nd
level.

Languages
A human character with Intelligence of 13
or more knows how to speak and write
additional languages. You, the DM, must
decide what languages are available.
In most D&D games, there are about 20
different languages used by monsters and
characters. You may select languages from
the List of Common Languages, or you
may allow the player to choose. Or if you
wish, you can make up more language
names if you think they will be used in
your games. (It is not necessary to actually
make up the languages themselves!) For
example, if you read the “Monsters” section carefully, you will discover that a Rock
Baboon communicates with simple
screams, and you may decide to allow this
“language” for player characters. Remember that the Undead do not have languages.
LIST OF COMMON LANGUAGES
1 . Bugbear
2. Doppleganger
3. Dragon
4. Dwarf
5. Elf
6. Gar oyle
7. Gnofi
8. Gnome
9. Goblin
10. Halfling

13. Kobold
14. Lizard Man
15. Medusa

17. Ogre or Giant
18. Orc
19. Pixie
20. Other human
tongue

Listening
Any character may listen for noises. This
occurs most often at doors, but may occur
anywhere. When an attempt at listening is
made, the area must be quiet to result in
any success. At a door by a waterfall, for
example, listening is nearly impossible. If
the area is quiet, all the characters must
also be quiet to have any success. This
means that everyone must stop and wait
while one or more characters listen, because armor, weapons, and other items
make noise when moving.
18

If any player says “1’11 listen for noises,”
roll ld6. You should always roll, whether or
not there is anything to hear, to keep the
players guessing. If the result is a 1 (1-2 for
a dwarf, elf or halfling), any noise being
made is heard, if conditions permit success.
A 1st or 2nd level thief has the same
chances to Hear Noise as a demi-human.
As more levels are gained, the thief becomes more expert at hearing noise.

Giving Magic-Users Spells
When a player starts a magic-user or elf
character, the player will ask you what
spells the character has in the spell book.
The magic-user’s teacher is a higher level
NPC magic-user, and the spells come from
the teacher. The “spell book assumed in
the game can simply be a list of spells kept
on the character sheet. You may play the
role of the teacher if you wish, but this may
also be assumed.
This system for spells allows you, the
DM, to keep control of the spells used in
the game. For example, you may wish to
avoid Charm Person spells. You can avoid
it simply by not giving it to the characters.
The first spell given should always be
Read Magic. This allows the character to
read scrolls found, and would be a basic
part of the character’s training.
The second spell given to a beginning
magic-user character should be fairly
powerful. You should avoid giving Detect
Magic, Light, or Protection From Evil as
the second spell, as these are nearly the
same as the cleric versions (easily acquired
by a 2nd or higher level cleric).
You may give any “second spell” to a
beginning elf character. The elf‘s many
talents keep that character class balanced
with the others, whatever spells are known.
The player of an elf can feel useful in
many ways; the spell is an additional
bonus, not the character’s only specialty. A
magic-user character is different. The
magic-user has only one specialty - spells
- and suffers from low hit points, poor
Armor Class, and severe weapon restrictions.
For magic-user characters, good “second
spells” are Charm Person, Magic Missile,
Sleep (all useful attack-type spells), and
Shield (a valuable protection).

Procedures and rules
The Floating Disc, Hold Portal, read
Languages, and Ventriloquism spells are
useful; however, the player of a beginning
magic-user may feel useless in an adventure if “miscellaneous” spells (which includes Read Magic) are the only ones
known. These spells make good “third
spells,” when the character reaches second
level.
You may wish to give one spell to one
beginning magic-user and a different spell
to another .beginner. This increases the
number of different spells available to a
party. However, be sure to give spells fairly.
Try to give one powerful spell to each, to
avoid complaints of unfairness.

Lost Spell Books
If a magic-user or elf character loses a spell
book, the character has a big problem.
Nobody would allow the character to use a
borrowed book, and without a book the
character has no spells to memorize! You
should always offer some method for the
character to find a lost book or gain a new
one. This should not be easy; it may involve paying a large sum of money (or an
unbreakable promise to pay in the future),
a special service or journey, dangerous
adventure, or some other method. Remember that the character is heavily penalized by the loss of the book, and the player
will probably not have much fun until it is
recovered.

Mapping
Mapping a dungeon is one of the biggest
problems for beginning players. You can
make it easier by following some simple
guidelines:
1. Describe areas clearly and accurately. If
you make a mistake, tell the players
right away, and make necessary corrections.
2. Use the same terms in descriptions, and
try to describe room details (size of the
room, exits, creatures, other contents)
in the same order each time. If the
players become familiar with certain
often-used terms, they can map more
easily. Some common terms for corridors are:
Side passage (or Sideroad): A corridor branches off to one side, but
the main corridor continues.
Four-way Intersection: Corridors
branch off to both sides of the main
corridor.
T-Intersection: The main corridor
ends at an intersection where corridors continue left and right.

Set a standard description at the start of
the adventure for corridors, rooms,
walls, and other typical features. For
example, if you start by saying “A standard corridor is 10’ wide and 10’ hi h,”
you can simply say “standard corri or”
instead of describing it each time. Standard walls might be “made of stone
blocks, each 2‘ long and 1’ tall, mortared on all sides,” and no further wall
description is needed unless it differs
from the Standard.
When you design your own dungeons,
use straight corridors and square rooms
at first. You may try other shapes and
twisty corridors when you and the players are more experienced - but even
then, it will still slow down the game.

%

Morale (Optional)
Morale is a measure of a creature’s courage, loyalty, and high spirits. It is optional
in your first games. The beginning Dungeon Master should not use Morale until all
the other game mechanics have been
learned. Morale should be added after
everyone, both DM and players, has participated in 2 or more group games.
In combat, any creature may try to run
away or surrender. A character may do
this, but this is the decision of the player.
No PC can be forced to surrender or run if
the player doesn’t want to.
To determine whether an NPC or monster wants to surrender or run away, the
DM uses the creature’s Morale Score, given
with the monster’s description. Good Morale (a high score) indicates a willingness to
keep fighting; bad Morale (a low score)
means that the creature may panic and try
to get away from combat. The Morale
Score is used when the DM Checks Morale
at certain times, by rolling dice.

How to Check Morale
When a Morale Check is necessary, the DM
rolls 2d6:
If the result is greater t h n the creatures’
Morale Score, the creatures will try to stop
the fight or get away from it.
If the result is less t h n or e p l to the
Morale Score, the creatures will continue
to fight.

When to Check Morale
A Morale Check is not made for any creature with a Morale Score of 2 or 12. A
Morale of 2 means that the creature will
not fight. A score of 12 means that the
creature will not quit, once it has begun to
fight.

19

For all Morale Scores from 3 to 11, a
Morale Check is made twice after Combat
begins. For a single creature encountered
alone, a Morale Check is made:
When the creature is first hit (taking 1
or more hit points of damage)
When the creature is reduced to Y4 of
its starting hit points (damaged for Y4 or
more)
Groups of creatures, a Morale Check is
made for the entire group:
1. When the first death on either side
occurs (either a monster or character)
2. When half of the monsters are not
free to act - killed, magically asleep
or controlled, etc.

Retainer’s Morale
A retainer’s morale is determined by the
employer’s Charisma score, and is not
checked for every situation occurring in
the description above. Instead, a retainer’s
morale is only checked during an adventure if:
1. The employer orders the retainer to
endanger himself (or herself) while the
party is in less danger; or 2. The retainer is damaged, and down to
Y4 of the original hit points or less
(damaged for 7 4 or more).

Adjustments to the Morale Check
The DM may decide to adjust a Morale
Check by a penatly of + 2 or +1, no
adjustment, or a bonus of - 1 or - 2. For
example, if the monsters have slain a PC, a
Morale Check is made, but with a bonus to
the roll; if no monsters have been killed, a
- 2 bonus is applied, or - 1 if they have
lost one or more of their group at the same
time. If the party is using a lot of magic
against the monsters, the Morale may be
penalized, due to fear.

Results of the Morale Check
If a creature (or creatures) fail to make the
Morale Check, it (or they) will try to get
away from the battle. This could be a
Retreat or Fi hting Withdrawal (see the
Additional d e s section of the PLAYERS
MANUAL) or, if neither of those is possible, a Surrender. If an intelligent creature
Surrenders, it will usually offer treasure
(from its lair or friends) as payment for its
life.

Procedures and rules
Surrender: Though a creature may offer
to surrender, the opponent (whether monster or character!) does not have to accept
the offer, nor even stop fighting long
enough to listen. The DM should play the
role of a surrendering monster with care;
remember that even non-intelligent creatures will usually act reasonably and run
from hopeless battles.

Multiple Characters
You should not allow beginning players to
play more than one character at the same
time. It can be hard enough to play the
role of one character; two or more can be
very confusing. However, when the players
are more experienced, you may consider
this as an optional system.
If you have two towns in your fantasy
game world, you may allow each player to
have a character in each town. This can be
more interesting, and allows the players to
try different classes.

New Rules and Items
During the play of the game, a player will
eventually try something not explained in
these rules.
If a character wants to d o something that
could be based on an Ability Score, a test of
that score could be used. For example, if a
huge boulder blocks the corridor and a
Fighter says “I’ll try to move it,” this action
is based on Strength. Two ways a DM
might decide to handle this are:
1. If the Strength score or less is rolled on
ld20, the attempt succeeds. Penalties
for heavier objects are decided by the
DM by adding a number to the roll.
2. If the Strength score or less is rolled on
3d6, the attempt succeeds. More or
different dice are used for heavier objects (4d6, 5d4, 3d8,5d6, and so forth).
Be sure to write down any rules you create,
and apply them fairly to everyone.
These are only suggestions; you are free
to make up any reasonable rules and apply
them as needed. However, remember that
more rules are given in the D&D EXPERT
set, and even more in the COMPANION
and MASTERS sets. If you create a rule
and then find a different rule for the
situation in one of these sets, the rule
should be changed to the official one. Just
tell the players that there is a change, to be
fair to them.

New Items and Monsters
Experienced Dungeon Masters often make
up their own monsters, treasures, spells,

and so forth. This is not recommended for
beginners. The entire game system is carefully balanced, and a too-powerful item is
very hard to get rid of, once it has been put
into the game. When you start to include
your own creations, make them similar to
the things in this book, at first. Magic items
usually have charges, monsters and character classes all have strengths and weaknesses, and spells have definite uses, divided between the two types. More items
are also given in the EXPERT and COMPANION Sets.

Questions
I f you don’t understand how something is
done in the game, look carefully for the
rules. Many answers can be found by reviewing all the rules after playing a few
games.
Some of your remaining questions are
answered in the D&D EXPERT Set, which
gives rules for outdoor adventuring, NPC
specialists (such as Armorer and Spy), and
many other situations.
You may also find answers from other
more experienced players in your area.
Millions of people play D&D games, and
you may find others at hobby shops,
schools, libraries, and other places.
If you can’t find an answer to your
questions, you may write to the creators of
the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game.

ready to go. Make up a retainer sheet, and
start the game.
If you AND THE PLAYERS decide to
make the finding and hiring of retainers
part of the game, you should be ready for
the following situations:

1. The character will search for retainers.
You should be ready to describe the
“local tavern” in town, or some other
location where retainers can be found.
2. Many “Normal Men,” unsuited for adventure, would apply for the job.
Among them should be one or more 1st
level NPCs of the types sought. The
details of the Normal Men need not be
specified, but you should be ready to
describe them generally if the player
asks.
3. The details of the NPC hired may be
made up, instead of rolled. You can
assume that an NPC fighter would have
above-average Strength, for example.
Personality traits, such as “miserly” or
“hates elves”) can add flavor to a game,
and help make the NPC memorable and more fun for all.
Retainer Reactions
When the rate of pay is offered and the job
described, you should roll 2d6 to see if the
retainer accepts the job. You may adjust
the roll by 1 for good pay, or by - 1 for a
poor offer. Charisma adjustments should
also apply.
If the characters are too poor to afford
the proper pay of a retainer, you may allow
the retainer to accept a half-share of treasure found. With such an offer, add 3 to the
following die roll.

+

RETAINER REACTION TABLE

Retainers
Be sure you are familiar with the rules for
retainers (PLAYERS MANUAL, page 62).
If there are 3 or more players, no retainers
should be needed. However, if only 1 or 2
players are available, many dungeons may
be too difficult for their characters alone,
and you may allow them to find and hire
retainers.
This will only be necessary if there are
very few players and if the player characters are not powerful enough to do well on
their own. Fighter characters can usually
do well alone, as can clerics, dwarves, elves,
and halflings.
First and foremost - if you want the
characters to take one or two retainers, go
ahead and do it. Don’t worry about the
retainer reactions, pay rates, or other details. Assume that a retainer (or more if
you wish) has been found, hired for a price
Gust tell the player the amount), and is

Retainer Morale
The morale of a retainer is a measure of
the NPC’s willingness to follow the PC in
the face of danger. If the morale score is a
high number (good morale), the retainer
will stand fast, but if it is a low number (bad
morale), the NPC may run away in a
dangerous situation. The morale score is

Procedures and rules
determined by the employing character’s
Charisma score (PLAYERS MANUAL, page
51). It may be adjusted due to PC actions,
rewards, and so forth. Retainer morale
should be checked after each adventure, and
may be checked during adventures.
Morale is an optional rule, fully explained on page 19. Retainers should not
be used without also using the Morale
rules.

Sleep Spells
Whenever a magic-user or elf casts a sleep
spell, the player will ask you for the effect.
This powerful spell will affect any “normal” creature with 4 1 Hit Dice or less.
There is no Saving Throw against its
effects. Undead are not affected, nor are
magical or fantastic creatures (such as
gar oyle, medusa, etc.).
randomly determine the number of
creatures affected, roll 2d8. The result is
the number of Hit Dice affected. Ignore
any additions or subtractions to the Hit
Dice, and use the first Hit Dice number
alone. For example, Lizard Men ( 2 + l Hit
Dice each) are treated as 2 Hit Dice creatures. Goblins (1- 1 Hit Dice) are treated as
1 Hit Die each.
A victim cannot be “partially asleep.” For
example, the spell is used against 5 Tiger
Beetles (3+1 Hit Dice). You roll 14 (on
2d8). Four of the monsters fall asleep,
while the fifth attacks the party. The “extra
2 Hit Dice” rolled are not used.
If cast at a mixed group of creatures, the
spell will affect the smallest ones first.
Example: The spell is cast at a group of 3
bugbears (3+1 HD) and 2 ogres (4+1
HD). You roll 12 on 2d8. All three bugbears fall asleep, but the ogres are not
affected.

+

#I

Optional: If you wish, you may select the
number affected instead of rolling dice. For
example, you might place 7 Carrion
Crawlers (3+1 Hit Dice) in a room and
allow a maximum (5) to be affected by this
spell, leaving 2 for the party to fight.

Thief Abilities
All DMs should be familiar with the special
abilities of thieves. If you are not, turn to
page 44 of the PLAYERS’ MANUAL and
read the descriptions. Most dungeon designs include several traps for only thieves
to (hopefully) find and remove, locks for
them to open, and sheer walls for their
special climbing skills.
When a player says “My thief characterwill
try to . . .” and names one of these abilities,
you must roll to determine the success of
the attempt. Hear Noise is checked by
rolling ld6; all the other abilities are
checked by rolling Percentage dice (d%).

Ask the player what the Percentage
chance is for the skill used. If you keep
records of the characters (in addition to the
character sheets -such as index cards), be
sure that the thief‘s percentages are in
your records. Roll the Percentage dice. If
the result is less than or equal to the chance
of success given, the attempt succeeds.
A failed attempt will often simply have
no result. The thief will know, for example,
that the lock has not been opened, that no
traps were found, that the wall was not
climbed, and so forth. However, a failed
attempt at Remove Traps may set off the
trap (DMs decision), or may leave it to be
triggered when a certain action occurs
(opening the chest or door, lifting the item,
etc.).
Attempts to Move Silently or Hide in
Shadows will always seem successful to the
thief. Only the DM knows for sure, based
on the result of the roll.
You may decide on any result without
rolling. For example, if a party is being
chased by an unbeatable monster and a
locked door stands between them and the
exit, you may automatically allow an Open
Locks attempt to succeed, to make the
game more fun by allowing the party to
escape - possibly after fighting the creature for a short time.

Timekeeping
You should keep a careful record of the
time used by characters during an adventure. Many spells have given durations,
movement is based on time, and your rolls
for Wandering Monsters are based on
time. You may simply. make notes on the
time used during an adventure, or you can
create a system (check marks, boxes to
cross off, etc.) for keeping track.

Transferring Characters
A player may come to your game with a
character created somewhere else. If this
occurs, examine the character sheet carefully. In general, you may allow the character to “transfer” into your game unless:
(a) it is of a higher level than the other
characters in the game
(b) more or better magic items are
owned than by other characters
(c) if the money owned is more than
50% greater than the amount owned
by any other character in your game.
Any one of these problems may be corrected, simply by changing the details on
the character sheet. But if allowed to remain unchanged, any one of them can
ruin your game! If any changes are necessary, you should talk about them with the
player, in private, before the game.

Turning Undead
Whenever a cleric character tries to Turn
undead monsters, the player will roll 2d6
and compare the total to the Turn Undead
chart (PLAYERS MANUAL, page 25). If
the attempt at Turning the undead is successful, the player will then ask you how
many monsters are affected.
To determine the number at random,
roll 2d6. The result is the number of Hit
Dice of Undead affected. An easy reference chart is given.

Optional: You may decide on the number
of Undead Turned, without rolling, if desired. For example, you may place 15 skeletons in an area, and give the cleric an
automatic maximum (12) Turned, leaving
3 for the party to fight.

A wraith looks like a shadow which flies,
and drains levels as a wight. A mummy
does not drain levels.
A monster cannot be “partially Turned.”
For example: A cleric Turns some wights (3
HD each), and your roll is 8 (on 2d6). Two
wights (6 Hit Dice) run away; the 2 “extra”
Hit Dice are not used.
If an attempt at Turning Undead is
successful and more Undead remain, the
cleric may Turn them again. Once a failure
to Turn occurs, further attempts by that
cleric will have no effect.
The Turned monsters will leave the
area, but may return. They will stay away
for 1-10 rounds (roll or choose a time).
After the Turning “wears off,” you may
decide whether the monsters return, or
make a Reaction roll. If the result of the
roll is 8 or more, the undead return.

Monsters
General Notes
Many types of monsters are listed on the
following pages in alphabetical order. Monsters may be friendly or unfriendly, wild or
tame, normal animals or fantastic. The DM
uses these monsters as the friends and opponents of the player characters.

Dungeon Levels

Infravision
Many non-human monsters have infravision, in addition to normal sight. Infravision
is the ability to see 60’ in the dark by seeing
heat (and the lack of it). Normal and magical light makes infravision useless. Fire and
other heat sources can interfere with infravision, much as a bright flash can interfere with normal vision for a short time.
To infravision, warm things seem red,
and cold things seem blue. For example, a
arty of characters hidin in darkness could
ge seen as a group of reJdish shapes. Some
bodies would seem a faint pink (armor),
while others - an unarmored magic-user,
for example - would be a brighter red. A
cold pool of water would seem a deep blue
color. Even an item or creature which is the
same temperature as the surrounding air
(such as a table or a skeleton) can be dimly
seen with infravision.
Note that a character (such as a thief of
halfling) in complete darkness cannot hide
from a monster with infravision. Some light
source must be nearby to interfere with the
monster’s infravision, while casting shadows
in which the character could hide.

Hit Dice
A monster’s size and “toughness” is measured by its hit points. A monster’s hit
points are determined by rolling ezght-sided
dice. The number of dice used to determine
the monster’s hit points is called the monster’s “Hit Dice.”
The more Hit Dice a monster has, the
bigger and tougher it is, and the more XP
(experience points) it is worth.

Dungeons are often more than just a few
caves. In your first group adventure, the
ruins of a castle were explored. The cellar
below that floor of the castle is left for you
to fill with monsters and treasures. This is
called the “second level” of the dungeon.
The least dangerous (easiest) level of a
dungeon is always called the “first level” of
the dungeon, or “dungeon level one.” A
dungeon may be any number of levels deep.
In general, the deeper you explore in a
dungeon, the more dangerous it becomes.
Tougher (higher level) monsters are discovered - but the treasures should also be
larger. Dungeon levels and designs are explained in more detail on pages 47 - 48.

Monster Levels
A monster with 1 Hit Die is called a “first
level” monster. A monster with 2 Hit Dice is
a “second level” monster, and so forth. Any
“plusses” are ignored; for example, “2 1”
Hit Dice are treated simply as “2” for this
purpose.
Monsters are encountered most often on
the dungeon level equal to their level. For
example: A Goblin has 1-1 Hit Dice; it is a
first level monster.
Therefore, most of the Goblins encountered by a party will be found on the first
level of a dungeon. Goblins will be encountered less frequently on other levels of a
dungeon.
If encountered elsewhere in a dungeon,
the difference between the monster’s level
and the dungeon level is usually no more
than 2.

+

If a monster is encountered on an upper
(easier) level of the dungeon, the number
encountered should be less than the number
given. For example: Gnolls have 2 Hit Dice;
they are second level monsters. On dungeon level 2, 1-6 (ld6) should be encountered (the number given in the description).
However, on dungeon level one, the number should be less; 1-4 (ld4) might be found.
If a monster is encountered on a lower
dungeon level than its Hit Dice, the number
appearing should be more than the number
given. For example: On dungeon level three,
2-8 (2d4) gnolls might be encountered. On
level 4, 2-12 (2d6) might be encountered or more.
The DM may change the number appearin as desired. These guidelines are not
rufes, but are offered to help in creating
good, fair dungeons. If low level characters
encounter tough monsters on the first and
second levels of a dungeon, they might be
overpowered. Even using these guidelines,
they might encounter dangerous monsters,
but in very small numbers. For example,
The Number Appearing for Bugbears is 2-8
(2d4). Eight Bugbears can destroy a lowlevel party; using these guidelines, only 1-3
should be encountered on dungeon level
one.

Reactions
Monsters may have nearly any reaction to
the appearance of a party, unless the monster description says otherwise. To find the
monsters’ reactions, roll 2d6 and find the
total on the left side of the Monster Reaction Chart. Use the chart to find the monsters’ actions and any further rolls needed.

Sometimes the Hit Dice have a bonus or
penalty included, as a minus or plus number. This makes some monsters a little more
or less powerful than their Hit Dice would
indicate.
This number is added to or subtracted
from the total hit points rolled on all the Hit
Dice. For example, 2 + 1 Hit Dice means “the
total of two eight-sided dice, plus one
point,” or 3-17 hit points. In monster descriptions, the Hit Dice may be listed as 1-1
(“one minus one”), 1+ 2, 3 + 1, and so forth.
Every creature has at least 1 hit point,
regardless of any subtractions.

6-8

Number of Monsters
The number of monsters normally encountered is given in each monster description as
“Number Appearing.” These numbers are
used when the monster’s level is equal to the
dungeon level. The Number Appearing
should be adjusted if the monster’s level is
different from the dungeon level on which
they are encountered. The following guideline should be used:

*Wait 1 or more rounds, and consider character

Monsters
Character Actions
The actions of the PCs may affect the monsters’ reactions. The characters may talk
(negotiate), or may use hand motions if the
creatures don’t understand the PC languages. Your Reaction Roll may include an
adjustment to account for the actions of the
characters. Adjustments from PC actions
couldbea -20r -lpenalty,ora + l o r + 2

Effects of Charisma
If the monster or NPC encountered can
understand what is said by the PCs, the
bonus or penalty due to Charisma is applied
to the result, in addition to bonuses or penalties due to Character Actions.

acts fierce, many creatures can be scared
away or forced to surrender - although
large and tough monsters probably won’t
scare very easily.
You may find more information on the
reactions and behavior of animals and other
“normal” monsters at your local library.

Saving Throws

Negotiation
Uncertain monsters may try to talk or Negotiate. If they can communicate somehow,
through words or hand motions, the monsters may suggest that some sort of agreement be made.
For example, a monster might fear the
party, and offer to pay them if they will go
away! In exchange for its friendship, a
hungry creature might ask for food. (A
hungry animal might lick its lips, obviously
hungry but apparently not wanting to attack the characters.) A more intelligent
monster might want a bribe, threatening to
attack unless the characters give it something. This process of making offers and
discussing them is called Negotiation.
A Chaotic monster will not necessarily
keep its promises! Chaotics are not dependable. There are many Chaotic monsters.
A Neutral monster will usually keep its
word, especially if it could be risky to break
it. It will do what is best for itself. More
monsters are Neutral than either of the
other Alignments.
A Lawful monster will always do what it
has promised; its word is as good as a
written contract. However, there are very
few Lawful monsters.
Reactions can make the game much more
fun than having fights. With some careful
thought, a good DM can keep everyone
interested and challenged by the situations
that can arise. Remember that no creature

rolls and damage rolls are made the same
way for both monsters and characters. The
Monsters’ Hit Table, however, is different.
In general, the bigger or tougher the monster, the easier it hits.
To find the Hit Roll needed by an attacking monster, find the monster’s Hit Dice
(always given in the description) on the
chart. The Hit Chart for that monster is the
line of numbers next to the Hit Dice. Part of
the chart is given here; the entire chart is
given on page 49, for easy reference.

When a character casts a magic spell at a
monster, the creature has a chance to avoid
the effects, just as characters do. Similarly,
monsters have the same types of Saving
Throws as characters - vs. Death Ray or
Poison, Magic Wands, and so forth.
Monsters’ Saving Throws are found on
the Characters’ Saving Throw Charts. In
every monster description, a Character
Class and Level will be given for the DM to
find the creature’s Saving Throw. This is
noted as “Save As: . . .” A full chart is given
on page 49, for easy reference.
In general, monsters make Saving
Throws as the character type to which they
are the most similar. Unintelligent monsters
make Saving Throws as if Fighters of a level
equal to one-half of their Hit Dice.

Special attacks
Many monsters have Special Attacks, which
are mentioned in the descriptions. A character can usually avoid the effects of a
Special Attack if a Saving Throw is successfully made (though Energy Drain has
no saving throw). Read the following explanations carefully, and refer to this section
whenever Special Attacks are used in a
game.

Blindness: In the Basic game, blindness
may result from certain spells or actions, or
when fighting in the dark without infravi-

sion. Some forms of “blindness” do not
involve sight! The bat and giant shrew, for
example, “see” using sound, and may be
“blinded” by the cleric spell Silence 15’
radius. The rule given is simply “the victim
of blindness may not move or attack.” However, you may use the following optional
system if desired.
A blinded creature may attack, but with a
-4 penalty on all Hit rolls. Anyone attacking a blinded creature gains a + 4 bonus to
all Hit rolls, since the victim cannot properly
defend itself. A blinded creature may move
at Y3 normal speed, or up to Y3 normal
speed if guided or led.
A character cannot normally attack an
invisible opponent. However, if the magicuser spell Detect Invisible is used, the caster
may guide others, by words or actions,
making attacks possible. The characters attacking the invisible creature may be treated
as if blinded, using the guidelines given
above.

Charm: Some monsters can enchant a character so that the character is confused, believing that the monster is a friend. If a
character is the victim of a Charm attack
(from a Harpy, for example) and fails a
Saving Throw vs. Spells, the character is
immediately Charmed. (Bargle, the magicuser in your first adventure, Charmed your
fighter.)
A Charmed character is confused and
unable to make decisions. The Charmed
character will not attack or harm the
Charming monster in any way, and will obey
simple commands from the creature if they
both understand a language (whether the
alignment tongue or some other language).
If the Charmed character does not understand the monster’s speech, the character
will still try to protect the monster from
harm. Charmed characters are too confused
to use any spells or magic items which
require concentration.

Monsters
If the Charming monster is killed, the
Charm effect disappears. (A higher level
spell, Dispel Magic, can be used to break
the Charm without killing the monster.)

Energy Drain: This is a dangerous attack
form, with no Saving Throw allowed. If a
character is hit by an Energy Drain attack
(by a wight, for example), the character
loses one Level of Experience! (A monster
would lose one Hit Die from this effect.)
The Energy Drain removes all the benefits
of that Level - hit points, spells, and so
forth - as soon as it occurs. The victim’s
Experience Point total drops to the midpoint
of the new level.
A 1st level character hit by an Energy
Drain attack is killed. There is normally no
way to cure an Energy Drain. The character
can only regain the Level through normal
adventuring and earning the Experience
Points all over again.

failure to a number of hit points of
damage. The failed Saving Throw may
still cause death from damage, but often
will not, and the game may continue. A
regular system of damage - such as 1, 2,
3, or 4 points per hit die of the monsters
- is recommended.

Monster Descriptions
Each entry on the following pages has a
description of the monsters, often including
notes on their behavior. A list of details is
given above each description. These details
are called the statistics for that monster.
They are always given in the same order.

Name: If the name of a monster is followed
by an asterisk (*), then a special or magical
weapon is needed to hit that monster. You
should use these monsters with caution;
they are very dangerous to low-level characters.
Armor Class: This number is based on
several things, including the toughness of
the creature’s skin, its speed or agility, and
armor worn (if any). The DM may adjust
the AC for special situations. For example, a
hobgoblin is normally AC 6 (probably wearing leather armor), but may be changed to
AC 2 if plate mail armor is somehow found
and used by the creature.

Paralysis: This effect “freezes” a character.
If a character is hit by a Paralyzing attack
and fails the Saving Throw vs. Paralysis, the
character is unable to do anything. The
character is not dead, and a character cannot
die from mere paralysis.
A paralyzed character remains awake,
aware of what is happening, but cannot do
anything that requires movement (including speaking, spell casting, and so forth)
until the paralysis ends. All attacks on a
paralyzed creature will automatically hit; only
a roll for damage is made. Paralysis itself
has no permanent effects of any kind. It
lasts for 2-8 turns (unless a different number is given in the monster description).
The cleric spell Cure Light Wounds can be
used to remove the paralysis, but will not
cure any damage when used for this purpose.
Poison: Poison is a danger to all characters.
If a character is hit by a poisonous attack (by
a snake, for example) and misses the Saving
Throw vs. Poison, the character will usually
die. (In the D&D EXPERT rules, poison can
be cured with a magic spell.)
Poison Damage
(Optional): Since “instant death” by poison can swiftly remove the fun of a
game, the DM may change the effect of

Hit Dice: This gives the number of eightsided dice (&) used to find the monster’s hit
points. Read the full explanation of Hit Dice
on page 22 to be sure you understand the
term.
If an asterisk (*) appears next to the Hit
Dice number, the monster has a special
ability (given in the description). Two or
three asterisks may be given, one for each
special ability. Special abilities affect the
number of XP earned for defeating the
monster, as explained on page 12.
Move: This gives the movement rate for the
monster, The number of feet the monster
moves in one 10-minute turn is given first,
followed by the movement rate per round
(for encounters).
Some monsters have a second movement
rate. The first is the rate when walking, and
the second is a special form of movement,
such as swimming, flying, or climbing.
Attacks: This gives the number and type of
attacks which the monster can use in one
round.
Damage: If a monster hits a target, damage
is inflicted; the amount is given here as a
range. When a monster has more than one
attack in a round, the attacks and damages
are given in the same order. “By weapon”
means that the monster always attacks with
a weapon. The damage is either 1-6 or, if
Variable Weapon Damage is used, deter24

mined by the weapon type.

No. Appearing (Number Appearing): The
first range of numbers given here shows the
number of monsters normally found in a
dungeon room. If “0” is given, the creatures
are not normally found in a dungeon. The
second range (in parentheses) gives the
number found outdoors, in wilderness.
This is also the suggested number of monsters in a dungeon lair. In the wilderness
lair, 5 times this number is suggested. If
“(0)”is given, the creatures are not normally
found outside of dungeons.
If a monster is found on a dungeon level
different from its level (Hit Dice), the Number Appearing should be changed. This is
explained fully on page 22, in the “Number
of Monsters” section.
Save As: The Saving Throw numbers for
monsters are the same as those for character
classes. The Saving Throws for all classes,
including higher level characters and “Normal Men,” are given on page 49.
Morale: This number is the suggested morale of the monsters. Morale is an optional
rule (explained on page 19),which is used in
combat to determine whether the monsters
run away, surrender, or fight to the death.
Treasure Type: To find the treasure
guarded by the monsters, compare the letter given here to the letters on the Treasure
Types Chart (pages 40-41). Complete instructions for using the chart are given on
that page. “Nil” indicates no treasure.
If a Treasure Type is given in parentheses, it is the treasure carried by the
monster. If two Treasure Types are given,
the first (in parentheses) is the treasure carried, and the second is the treasure in the
monster’s lair. If no parentheses are used, the
monster carries no treasure.
Alignment: Monsters may be Lawful, Neutral, or Chaotic. Animals are usually Neutral. A good Dungeon Master always considers alignment when playing the role of a
monster. Only intelligent monsters can
speak an Alignment language.
XP value: The Experience Points to be
awarded for the defeat of ONE of that type
of monster are given here. However, the
DM may give more XP for monsters in
“tough” encounters, such as an attack on a
well-defended lair. See page 12 for more
details on XP awards.
Description: A general description of the
monster’s habits is given below the statistics,
including details of any special abilities or
behavior. The following terms may be used:
A Carnivore is a creature that prefers to
eat meat, and does not usually eat plants.

Monsters
An Herbivore is a creature that prefers to
eat plants rather than meat.
An Insectivore is a creature that prefers
to eat insects, rather than plants or red
meat.
An Omnivore is a creature that will eat
nearly anything edible.
A Nocturnal creature is normally active
at night, sleeping during the day. However,
dungeons are often dark as night, and a
nocturnal creature may be awake during
“daylight hours” if found within a dark
dungeon.
A monster’s home is called its lair. Most
monster lairs are in dungeon rooms or
outside, hidden in the wilderness. Most
monsters will defend their lairs fiercely.

Giant ants are black ants about 6‘ long.
They are omnivores, and will devour anything edible which lies in their path (no
reaction roll). Once engaged in combat,
they will fight to the death, even trying to
cross flames to reach their opponents. The
nest-lair will always be guarded by 4-24
giant ants. There are legends of giant ants
mining gold, and there is a 30% chance that
a lair will contain 1-10 thousand gp worth of
nuggets.

White apes have lost their color due to many
years of living in caves. They are nocturnal

herbivores, looking for fruits and vegetables
at night. If creatures approach their lair, the
apes will threaten them. If their threats are
ignored, they will attack. They may throw
one stone per round for ld6 points each.

Rock baboons are larger versions of normal
baboons, and are more intelligent. They are
omnivores, but prefer meat. They do not
make tools or weapons but will pick up
bones or branches to use as clubs. Rock
baboons form packs, each led by a dominant

male. They are ferocious and have vicious

Bandits are NPC thieves who have joined

Bandits will act as normal humans so they
can surprise their intended victims. Treasure Type A is only found when bandits are
encountered in their wilderness lair. Bandits may have an NPC leader of any human

Bats are nocturnal flying insectivores. They
often live in caves or abandoned buildings,
and find their way about by echo-location (a
type of radar using hearing and echos to
locate objects). Since they have very weak
eyes, spells which affect sight (such as Light)
do not work on bats. However, a Silence 15‘
Radius spell will effectively “blind” a bat.

Normal Bats: Normal bats will not attack
men but may confuse them by flying
around their heads. There must be at least
ten bats to confuse one character. Characters who are confued have a - 2 penalty on
their Hit Rolls and Saving Throws and
cannot cast spells. Normal bats must check
morale each round unless they are controlled or summoned.

25

Giant Bats: Giant Bats are carnivores and
may attack a party if extremely hungry. Five
percent of all giant.bat encounters will be
groups of giant vampire bats, far more
dangerous creatures (XP value 25). The bite
of a giant vampire bat does no extra damage
but its victim must make a Saving Throw vs.
Paralysis or fall unconscious for 1-10
rounds. This will allow the vampire bat to
feed without being disturbed, draining 1-4
points of blood per round. Any victims who
die from having their blood drained by a
giant vampire bat must make a Saving
Throw vs. Spells or become an undead
creature 24 hours after death. (If D&D
EXPERT rules are used, this may be a
vampire.)

Bears are well-known to all adventurers. If
any bear hits one victim with both paws in

Black bear: Black bears have black fur
and stand about 6’ tall. They are omnivores
but prefer roots and berries. A black bear

Giant Bees are foot-long giant bees with
very nasty tempers. They often attack on
sight, and will always attack anyone within

bee attack hits, the bee dies, but the creature
stung must make a Saving Throw vs. Poison
or die. The stinger will continue to work its
way into the victim, inflicting 1 point of
damage per round, unless a round is spent
pulling it out.

attack adventurers. These huge bears are
good swimmers, and their wide feet allow
them to run across snow without sinking.

Cave bear: A cave bear is a type of giant
grizzly bear which lives in caves and “lost
world areas. It stands about 15’ tall .and is
the most ferocious of all the bears. Though
it is an omnivore, a cave bear prefers fresh
meat. It has poor eyesight but a good sense
of smell. If hungry, it will follow a track of
blood until it has eaten.

There will always be at least 10 bees with
their queen in or near the hive. At least 4 of
these bees will have 1 Hit Die each. The
queen bee has 2 Hit Dice and can sting
repeatedly without dying. Giant bees make
magical honey. If the honey of an entire
hive is eaten (about 2 pints), it has an effect
like a half-strength potion of healing, curing 1-4 points of damage.

an oily fluid at one of its attackers (a Hit Roll

raises painful blisters, causing a - 2 penalty
on the victim’s Hit Rolls until cured by a
Cure Light Wounds spell or until 24 hours

blisters, it will not also cure damage. Oil
beetles can also attack with their mandibles

Tiger Beetle: Tiger beetles are 4’ long

Berserkers are fighters who go mad in

always fight to the death - sometimes attacking their comrades in their blind rage.
When fighting humans or human-like creatures (such as kobolds, goblins or orcs), they
add + 2 to their Hit Rolls due to this ferocity. They never retreat, surrender, or take

The “Great Cats” are normally cautious and
will avoid fights unless forced by extreme
hunger or when trapped with no escape
route. Though they may be found in a
relaxed or even playful mood, they are
subject to rapid and violent changes of
temper. They often develop a fondness for
one type of food, and will go out of their
way to hunt that type of prey. The Great
Cats rarely go deeply into caves, and usually
remember a quick escape route to the outdoors. Despite their shyness, they are very
inquisitive, and may follow a party out of
curiosity. They will always chase a fleeing
Prey.

Mountain Lion: This tawny-furred species lives mostly in mountainous regions but
also inhabits forests and deserts. They will
wander further into dungeons than any
other species of Great Cat.
Panther: Panthers are found on plains,

forests, and open shrub lands. They are
extremely quick and can outrun most prey
over short distances.

Lion: Lions generally live in warm climates and thrive in savannah and brush
lands near deserts. They usually hunt in
groups, known as prides.
Tiger: Tigers are the largest of the commonly found Great Cats. They prefer
cooler climates and wooded lands where
their striped bodies offer some degree of
camouflage, useful when hunting. They
often surprise their prey (on a roll of 1-4 on
ld6) when in woodlands.
Sabre-ToothTiger: Sabre-tooth tigers are
the largest and most ferocious of the Great
Cats. They have oversized fangs, from
which they get their name. Fortunately,
sabre-tooth tigers are mostly extinct, except
in “lost world” areas.

These man-sized shapechanging creatures
are intelligent and evil. A doppleganger is
able to shape itself into the exact form of
any human-like creature it sees (up to 7'
tall). Once in the form of the person it is
imitating, it attacks that person. Its favorite
trick is to kill the original person in some
way without alerting the party. Then, in the
role of that individual, it attacks the others
by surprise, often when they are already
engaged in combat. Sleep and charm spells
do not affect dopplegangers and they make
all Saving Throws as Fighter: 8 due to their
highly magical nature. When killed, a doppleganger turns back into its original form.

Dragons are a very old race of huge winged
lizards. They like to live in isolated, out-ofthe-way places where few men are found.
Though the color of their scaly hide makes
dragons look different, they all have quite a

from eggs, are carnivores, have Breath

Weapons, have a great love of treasure, and
will do everything possible to save their own
lives, including surrender. Breath Weapons,
treasure, and surrender (subduing a
dragon) are all explained in the following
description.

Monsters
Many dragons live hundreds or thousands of years. Because of their long history,
they tend to think less of the younger races
(such as Man). Chaotic dragons might capture men, but will usually kill and eat them
immediately. Neutral dragons might either
attack or ignore a party completely. Lawful
dragons, however, may actually help a party
if the characters are truly worthy of this
great honor. When playing a dragon, a DM
should keep in mind that, because of its
pride, even the hungriest dragon will pause
and listen to flattery (if no one is attacking
it, and if it understands the language of the
speaker).
Dragons are extremely powerful monsters and should be used with caution when
encountered by low level player characters
(such as those found in the D&D BASIC
rules). It is recommended that until characters reach the fourth and higher levels of
experience (see the D&D EXPERT rules)
that only the youngest and smallest dragons
be used.

Breath Weapon Damage: All dragons have
a special attack with their “Breath Weapon”
in addition to their claw and bite attacks.
Any dragon can use its Breath Weapon up
to 3 times each day. A dragon’s first attack is
always with its Breath Weapon. The number of points of damage any Breath Weapon
does is equal to the number of the dragon’s
hit points. Any damage done to a dragon
will reduce the damage it can do with its
Breath Weapon.
After the first Breath attack, a dragon
might choose to attack with claws and bite.
To determine this randomly, roll ld6:
1-3: the dragon will use its claw and bite
attacks;
4-6: the dragon will breathe again.

Shape of Breath: A dragon’s Breath
Weapon appears as one of three different
shapes: cone-shaped, a straight line, or a
cloud of gas.
A cone shaped Breath begins at the
dragon’s mouth (where it is 2‘ wide) and
spreads out until it is 30’ wide at its furthest
end. For example, the area of effect of a white
dragon’s Breath is a cone 80’ long and 30’
wide at its far end.
A line-shaped Breath starts in the dragon’s
mouth and stretches out toward its victim in a
straight line (even downward). Even at its
source, a line-shaped Breath is 5‘ wide.
A cloud-shaped Breath billows forth
from the dragon’smouth to form a 50‘ x 40’
cloud, 20’ tall, around the dragon’s targets
directly in front of it.

Saving Throws: Each victim within a
dragon’s Breath must make a Saving
Throw. This is always the Saving Throw vs.
Breath, even if the breath is similar to
another type of attack. If successful, the
victim takes only !h damage from the
Breath. Dragons are never affected by the
normal or smaller versions of their Breath
Weapons, and automatically make their Saving Throws against any attack form which is
the same as their Breath Weapon. For example, a red dragon will take no damage from
(and usually ignores) burning oil, and will
always take only Yz damage from a fire-type
magic spell, such as a Fire Ball.
Talking: Dragons are intelligent, and some
dragons can speak the Dragon and Common tongues. The percentage listed under
“Chance of Talking” is the chance that a
dragon will be able to talk. Talking dragons
are also able to use magic-user spells. The
number of spells and their levels are given
in the chart, For example, “ 3 3 -” means
that the dragon can cast 3 first level spells
and 3 second level spells, but no third level
spells. Dragon spells are usually selected
randomly.
Sleeping Dragons: The percentage chance
given under Chance of Being Asleep applies
whenever a party encounters a dragon on
the ground (flying dragons are never
asleep). Any result greater than the percentage means that the dragon is not asleep
(though it may be pretending to be!). If a
dragon is asleep, it may be attacked for one
round (with a bonus of + 2 on all Hit Rolls),
during which it will awaken. Combat is
handled normally for the second and further rounds.
Subduing Dragons: Whenever characters
encounter a dragon, they may choose to try
to subdue it rather than kill it. To subdue a
dragon, all attacks must be with “the flat of
the sword.” Thus, missile weapons and
spells may not be used to subdue. Attacks
and damage are determined normally, but
this “subduing damage” is not real damage.
The dragon will fight normally until it
reaches 0 or less hit points, at which time it
will surrender. The subduing damage does
not reduce the damage done by the
dragon’s Breath Weapon.
A dragon may be subdued because it
realizes that its attackers could have killed it
if they had been striking to kill. It therefore
surrenders, admitting that the opponents
have won the battle but saving its own life.
A subdued dragon will attempt to escape
or turn on its captor if given a reasonable
chance to do so through the party’s actions.
For example, a dragon left unguarded at
night, or who is ordered to guard a position
alone, would consider these “reasonable
chances.” A subdued dragon must be sold.
The price is up to the DM, but should never

29

exceed 1,000 gp per hit point. The dragon
may be forced to serve the characters who
subdued it. If a subdued dragon is ever
ordered to perform a task which is apparently suicidal, the dragon will attempt to
escape, and may try to kill its captors in the
process.

Age: The statistics given are for an averagesized dragon of its type. Younger dragons
are smaller and have acquired less treasure;
older dragons are larger and have acquired
more. Dragons generally range in size from
3 Hit Dice smaller to 3 Hit Dice larger than
average. For example, red dragons could be
found having 7 to 13 Hit Dice, depending
on their age.
Treasure: Younger dragons may have collected as little as YI to Yz the normal listed
treasure; older dragons may have as much
as double the listed amount. Dragon treasure is only found in a dragon’s lair. These
lairs are rarely left unguarded, and are wellhidden to prevent easy discovery.
Gold Dragons: Gold dragons always talk
and use spells. They can also change their
shape, and often appear in the form of a
human or animal. Gold dragons may
breathe either fire (like a red dragon) or
chlorine gas (like a green dragon), though
they still have a total of 3 Breath Weapon
attacks per day (not six). The type of Breath
used should be chosen by the DM to fit the
situation.

leader (level 3-8) who may have magical

multiply the leader’s level by 5. The result is

Gargoyles are magical monsters, and can
only be hit with magic or magical weapons.
As pictured in medieval architecture, they
are horned, clawed, fanged, winged, hideous-looking beasts. Their skin often looks
exactly like stone and they are often mis-

taken to be statues. Gargoyles are very cunning and at least semi-intelligent. They will
attack nearly anything that approaches
them. Gargoyles are not affected by Sleep
or Charm spells. The DM should not use
gargoyles unless the player characters have
at least one magical weapon.

This monster is made of a clear jelly, usually
in the form of a IO’ x 10’ x 10’ cube (though
other shapes are possible). It is hard to see,
and it surprises often (1-4 on ld6). A gelatinous cube moves through the rooms and
corridors of a dungeon, sweeping the halls
clean of all living and dead material. In the
process, it may pick up items it cannot
dissolve (such as weapons, coins, and gems).
It will attack any living creature it encounters. Any successful hit will paralyze the
victim unless a Saving Throw vs. Paralysis is
made. An attack on a paralyzed victim will
automatically hit (only a damage roll is
needed). This paralysis is the normal type
(lasting 2-8 turns unless magically cured). A
gelatinous cube may be harmed by fire and
weapons, but not by cold or lightning. The
lair of these strange monsters may contain
1-4 cubes, each with Treasure Type V but
usually with no additional treasure.

Sleep and Charm spells. They are hideous,
beast-like humans who will attack any living
thing. Any hit from a ghoul will paralyze
any creature of ogre-size or smaller (except
elves) unless the victim makes a Saving
Throw vs. Paralysis. Once an opponent is
paralyzed, the ghoul will turn and attack
another opponent, continuing until either
the ghoul or all the opponents are paralyzed

(lasting 2-8 turns unless magically cured).

Gnolls are beings of low intelligence that
appear to be human-like hyenas. They may
use all weapons. They are strong, but dislike
work and prefer to bully and steal. For
every 20 gnolls encountered, one will be a
leader with 16 hit points who attacks as a 3
hit dice monster. Gnolls are rumored to be
the result of a magical combination of a
gnome and a troll by an evil magic-user.

Gnomes are a human-like race related to
(but smaller than) dwarves, with long noses
and full beards. Gnomes have well-developed infravision, with a 90’ range. They
usually live in burrows in the lowlands.
Gnomes are excellent metalsmiths and
miners. They love gold and gems and have
been known to make bad decisions just to
obtain them. They love machinery of all
kinds and prefer crossbows and war hammers as weapons. Gnomes like most
dwarves, but war with goblins and kobolds
who steal their precious gold. They usually
attack kobolds on sight.
For every 20 gnomes, one will be a leader
with 11 hit points who fights as a 2 Hit Dice
monster. In the gnome lair lives a clan
chieftain and his 1-6 bodyguards. The clan
chieftain has 18 hit points, attacks as a 4 Hit
Dice monster, and gains a bonus of +1 on
damage rolls. The bodyguards have 10-13
hit points and attack as 3 Hit Dice monsters.
As long as the clan chieftain or leader is
alive, all gnomes within sight of him have a
morale of IO rather than 8.

Goblins are a human-like race, small and
very ugly. Their skin is a pale earthy color,
such as chalky tan or livid gray. Their eyes
are red, and glow when there is little light.
Goblins live underground and have welldeveloped infravision, with a 90' range. In
full daylight they fight with a penalty of - 1
on their Hit Rolls. Goblins hate dwarves and
will attack them on sight. There is a 20%
chance that when goblins are encountered
outdoors, 1 of every 4 will be riding a dire
wolf. In the goblin lair lives a goblin king
with 15 hit points who fights as a 3 Hit Dice
monster and gains a + 1 bonus to damage
rolls. The goblin king has a bodyguard of
2-12 goblins who fight as 2 Hit Dice monsters and have 2-12 hit points each. The
king and his bodyguard may fight in full
daylight without a penalty. The goblin morale is 9 rather than 7 as long as their king is
with them and still alive.

This seeping horror looks like wet stone and
is difficult to see. It secretes an acid which
does 2-16 points of damage if it touches bare
skin. This acid will dissolve and destroy
normal armor or weapons in only 1 round,
and magic items in one turn. After the first
hit, the ooze sticks to its victim, automatically destroying any normal armor and
continuing to inflict 2-16 points of damage
each round. Gray ooze cannot be harmed by
cold or fire, but can be harmed by weapons
and lightning. A lair may contain 1-3 oozes,
possibly with a special treasure made of
stone (DM's choice).

Green slime cannot be harmed by any attacks except fire or cold. It dissolves cloth or
leather instantly, wood and metal in 6
rounds, but cannot dissolve stone. Green
slime often clings to walls and ceilings and
drops down by surprise. Once in contact
with flesh, it sticks and turns the flesh into
green slime. It cannot be scraped off, but
may be burnt off (or treated with a Cure
Disease spell in the D&D EXPERT rules).
When green slime drops on a victim (or is
stepped on), the victim can usually burn it
while it is dissolving armor and clothing. If
it is not burned off, the victim will turn
completely into green slime 1-4 rounds after
the first 6-round (one minute) period.
Burning does Yz damage to the green slime
and Yz damage to the victim.

Hobgoblins are relatives of goblins, but are
bigger and meaner. They live underground
but often hunt outdoors (having no penalties in daylight). A hobgoblin king and 1-4
bodyguards live in the hobgoblin lair. The
king has 22 hit points and fights as a 5 Hit
Dice monster, gaining a bonus of + 2 on
damage rolls. The bodyguards all fight as 4
Hit Dice monsters and have 3-18 hit points
each. As long as their king is alive and with
them, hobgoblin morale is 10 rather than 8.

Humans may be encountered nearly anywhere. This description deals with occasional random encounters with 1-3 humans.
Other groups of humans are explained in
other entries (Bandit, Berserker, Normal
Man,and NPC Party).
Human encounters can provide many
opportunities for role playing by both the
DM and the players. They also create a
more realistic mood for the adventure. In
addition, they can be used to provide goals
for the player characters, and can lead to
entire adventures. In some cases, the reasons for the encounter may cause some
changes in nearby rooms of the dungeon.
For example, if the NPCs are Bait, the DM
may wish to place a harpy in a nearby empty
room, or to change a given monster to a
harpy. Treasure should also be changed as
necessary.
An encounter with humans will require
some work by the DM, but can be quite
entertaining. The NPC humans do not
need to be as detailed as player characters.
The DM may create each human NPC character in full detail, or may use the following
procedure to find the necessary details.
This same type of encounter may be
applied to demi-humans if desired; if so,
omit step #2.

Explanations of Reasons for Appearing:
The NPCs had set out by themselves for

for safety.
The NPCs are bait, either Charmed or
controlled bv a nearbv monster. The
NPCs will atiempt to l&ad the party to
the monster’s location without creating
suspicion. The monster may appear
while the NPCs distract the party.
The NPCs were prisoners of a nearby
monster, but have escaped. They have
little or no equipment. The monster
might appear soon if aware of their
escape.
The NPCs are looking for a friend,
either rumored or known to have disappeared in the dungeon. The friend
might be a prisoner of a nearby monster.
The NPCs are looking for a special item
either rumored or known to be in the
dungeon.
The NPCs are not mere humans. They
may be lycanthropes, dopplegangers, or
gold dragons. The DM should determine the monster type and run the
monsters normally.
The NPCs are running away from an
encounter with a nearby monster. The
monster may be chasing them.
The NPCs are the only survivors of a
recent battle with monsters. The remains of the rest of their party may be
found in a nearby monster lair.

A living statue is an enchanted animated
creature made by a powerful wizard. It
appears to be a perfectly normal statue until it moves! A living statue may be any
size or material. Living crystal, iron, and
rock statues are given as examples, and the
DM may create others. Living statues are
not affected by Sleep spells.

Iron: A living iron statue has a body
which can absorb iron and steel. It takes
normal damage when hit, but if a nonmagical metal weapon is used, the attacker
must make a Saving Throw vs. Spells or the
weapon will become stuck in the body of the
living iron statue, and may only be removed
if the statue is killed.

Crystal: A living crystal statue is a life
form made of crystals instead of flesh. It can
look like a statue of anything, but often
appears human.

Rock: A living rock statue has an outer
crust of stone but is filled with hot magma
(fiery lava). When the creature attacks, it
squirts the magma from its fingertips for
2-12 points of damage per hit.

Draco: A draco is a 6‘ long lizard with
wide flaps of skin between its legs. It
spreads these flaps to glide through the air,
like a flying squirrel. Dracos are generally
found above ground, though they sometimes creep into caves to escape very cold or
hot weather. They are carnivores and have
been known to attack adventurers.
Horned Chameleon: A horned chameleon is a 7‘ long lizard which can change
color to blend into its surroundings. It surprises on a roll of 1-5 (on ld6). A horned
chameleon can shoot out its sticky tongue
up to 5’ long. A successful hit means that
the victim is pulled to the horned chameleon’s mouth and bitten for 2-8 points of
damage. The creature can also attack with
its horn (for 1-6 points of damage) and may
use its tail to knock other attackers down
(make another Hit Roll, not doing any
damage but preventing the target struck
from attacking that round).
Tuatara: A tuatara is an 8‘ long carnivore
which looks like a cross between an iguana
and a toad. It has pebble-colored olive skin
with white spikes along its back. A tuatara
has a membrane over its eyes which, when
lowered, is sensitive to changes in temperature, allowing it to “see” in darkness (90’
infravision).

These water-dwelling creatures look like

demi-humans and take the victims back to
the tribal lair as the main course of a feast.
Lizard men are semi-intelligent and use
spears and large clubs (treat the clubs as
maces), gaining a bonus of + 1 on damage

Giant locusts are 2‘-3’ long and live underground. They may be mistaken for statues
(or might not be noticed at all) until approached, because of their stone-gray color.
They are herbivores, and also eat fungus
such as yellow mold and shriekers. They
cannot be harmed by yellow mold or most
poisons. Instead of fighting, they usually
flee by jumping away (up to 60’). Unfortunately they often become confused, and
may accidentally jump into a party (50%
chance per jump). If so, a victim is determined randomly and a Hit Roll is made. If
the giant locust hits a character, the victim is
battered for 1-4 points of damage. The
locust then flies away.

is treated as AC 9. A victim hit by giant

Werewolves: These creatures are semiintelligent and usually hunt in packs. Any

Werewolves summon normal wolves to

Wereboars: Wereboars are semi-intelligent and bad-tempered. In human form
they often seem to be berserkers, and may

Wereboars summon normal boars to help

Weretigers: These relatives of the Great
Cats often act like them, being very curious
but becoming dangerous when threatened.
They are good swimmers and quiet trackers, surprising often (1-4 on ld6). They may
summon any type of Great Cat that is in the
area (preferring tigers).
Werebears: Werebears are very intelligent, even in animal form. A werebear
usually prefers to live alone or with bears. It
might be friendly, however, if peacefully
approached. In combat, werebears may hug
for 2-16 points of damage (in addition to
normal damage) if both paws hit the same
target in one round. A werebear may summon any type of bear in the area.

alone in a dungeon, the mules may belong
to an NPC party nearby.

Neanderthals (also known as Cavemen)
have squat bodies with large bones and
powerful muscles. Their faces have ape-like
features, including large brows above the
eyes. Neanderthals live in family groups in
caves and caverns. They usually attack with
thrown spears and use stone axes, clubs, or
stone hammers in hand-to-hand combat.
Neanderthal leaders are almost a separate race, much larger than the average
Neanderthal. These leaders have 6 hit dice
and are 10‘ tall. There will be 10-40 Neanderthals in the lair with 2 leaders, one male
and one female. Neanderthals often hunt
cave bears and keep white apes as pets.
They are friendly toward dwarves and
gnomes, but hate goblins and kobolds, and
will attack ogres on sight. Neanderthals are
shy and will avoid humans, but are not
usually hostile unless they are attacked.

“Normal human” is the game term for a
human who does not seek adventure. A
normal human does not have a class. The
hit points should be selected, according to
the human’s age, health, and profession. For
example, a blacksmith could have 8 hp, but a
young child or sickly beggar might have
only 1 hp.
Most humans are “normal” humans,
though people with certain professions
(such as merchant, soldier, lord, scout, and
so forth) help in some adventures. As soon
as a human gets experience points through
an adventure, that person must choose a
character class. Some typical normal humans are peasants, children, housewives,
workers, artists, villagers, townspeople,
slaves, fishermen, and scholars.

An ochre jelly is an ochre-colored giant
amoeba which can only be harmed by fire or

and 2 children ("whelps") for each 2 adults.
The leader of an orc tribe is a chieftain with
15 hit points, who attacks as a 4 Hit Dice
monster and gains + 2 on damage rolls. For
every 20 orcs in a tribe, there may be an
ogre with them (1 in 6 chance). (If the D&D
EXPERT rules are used, there is a 1 in 10
chance of a troll living in the lair as well.)

NPC class and level

An NPC party is any group of non-player
characters. Each NPC may be of any class,
level, and Alignment. All rules for player
characters apply to NPCs. An NPC party
may be created in great detail before a
game.
Most parties (whether NPCs or PCs) will
not want to fight other parties, preferring
easier monsters to challenge. The DM may
wish to avoid the large, complicated battle
which could occur between two parties. To
avoid combat, the DM may use the following
chart to determine the actions of the NPC
party.
For ease of play, the DM may give the
NPC party the same number of members as
in the PC party, plus 1-4 fighters (to discourage PC ideas of attack). Similar classes
and equipment may be assumed, if the
NPCs are nearly the same level of experience as the player characters.

Ogres are huge fearsome human-like creatures, usually 8 to 10 feet tall. They wear
animal skins for clothes, and often live in
caves. When encountered outside their lair,
the group will be carrying 100-600 gp in
large sacks. Ogres hate Neanderthals and
will attack them on sight.

An owl bear is a huge bear-like creature
with the head of a giant owl. It stands 8' tall
and weighs 15,000 cn. If both its paws hit
one opponent in one round, the owl bear
hugs for an additional 2-16 points of
damage. Owl bears have nasty tempers and
are usually hungry, preferring meat. They
are commonly found underground and in

An orc is an ugly human-like creature, and
looks like a combination of animal and man.
Orcs are nocturnal omnivores, and prefer
to live underground. When fighting in
daylight, they have a penalty of - 1 on their
Hit Rolls. Orcs have bad tempers and do not
like other living things.
One member of each group of orcs is a
leader with 8 hit points who gains a + 1
bonus on damage rolls. If this leader is
killed, the morale of the group becomes 6
instead of 8. Orcs are afraid of anything
larger or stronger than they are, but may be
forced to fight by their leaders.
Orcs are often used for armies by Chaotic
leaders (both humans and monsters). They
prefer swords, spears, axes, and clubs for
weapons. They will not use mechanical
weapons (such as catapults), and only their
leaders understand how to operate such
devices.
There are many different tribes of orcs.
Each tribe has as many female orcs as males,

Pixies are small human-like creatures with
insect-like wings. They are distantly related
to elves, but are only 1'-2' tall. They are
invisible unless they want to be seen (or
unless magically detected). Unlike the
effects of the invisibility spell, pixies can
attack and remain invisible, and they always
gain surprise when doing so. They may not
be attacked in the first round of combat, but
after that their attackers will see shadows
and movement in the air and may attack the
pixies with a - 4 penalty on Hit Rolls. Their
small insect-like wings can only support
pixies for 3 turns, and they must rest one

good swimmers and may attack while in
water. They are afraid of fire, and will run

and some rats carry diseases. Anyone bitten
by a rat has a 1 in 20 chance of being
infected. (This chance should be checked

the XP award is 6.) The victim may still

Normal Rats: Normal rats have gray or

long. They attack in “packs” of 5-10. If there
are more than 10 rats they will attack several
creatures as packs of 10 or less. A pack will
only attack one creature at a time. Rats will
climb all over the creature they are attacking, often knocking the victim down.
Giant Rats: These creatures are 3’ long or

often found in the dark corners of dungeon
rooms and in areas with undead monsters.

A robber fly is a 3’ long giant fly with black
and yellow stripes. From a distance, robber
flies look like killer bees. They are carnivores, and may attack adventurers. However, they prefer killer bees as food, and are
immune to their poison. Robber flies are
patient hunters. They often hide in shadows
and wait to surprise prey (1-4 on ld6). A
robber fly can leap up to 30’ and attack with
its bite.

A rust monster has a body like a giant
armadillo with a long tail, and 2 long front
“feelers” (antennae). If a rust monster hits a
character with its antenna, it will cause any
non-magical metal armor or weapon hit to
immediately crumble to rust. It may be hit
by any type of weapon, and a successful Hit
Roll indicates that the body is hit, for no ill
effect to the weapon used. A rust monster is
attracted by the smell of metal. It eats the
rust created by its attacks. A magical armor
or weapon struck usually loses one “plus”
per hit, but has a 10% chance per “plus” of
resisting the effect completely.
For example, a shield + 1 has a 10%chance
of surviving the attack. If 11 or greater is
rolled on d%, the shield is reduced to a
normal shield. If hit again, it crumbles into
rust.

Shadows are non-corporeal (ghostlike) intelligent creatures. They can only be
harmed by magical weapons. They look like
real shadows and can alter their shape
slightly. Shadows are hard to see and usually
gain surpirse (1-5 on ld6). If a shadow
scores a hit, it will drain 1 point of Strength
in addition to doing normal damage. This
weakness will last for 8 turns. Any creature
whose Strength is reduced to zero becomes
a shadow immediately. Shadows are not
affected by Sleep or Charm spells, but they
are not Undead and cannot be Turned by
clerics. The DM should not use shadows
unless the party has at least one magical
weapon.

Giant shrews look like brown-furred rats
with long snouts. They can burrow, climb,
or jump (up to 5’). The eyes of a giant
shrew are so weak that the creature is not
affected by light or the lack of it. A shrew
uses radar-like squeaks to “see” its surroundings (as bats do), and can “see” things
within 60’ as well as a creature with normal
sight. Since it needs echoes to “see,” a giant
shrew dislikes open areas, and remains underground most of the time. A Silence 15’
Radius spell will “blind a giant shrew. If it
cannot hear, it will be confused, and then
becomes AC 8, with a penalty of -4 on its
Hit Rolls.
A giant shrew is very quick and will always
take the initiative on its first attack. It also
gains a + 1 bonus on its initiative roll for the
remaining rounds of combat. Its attack is so
ferocious (attacking the head and shoulders
of the defender) that any victim of 3 Hit Dice
(3rd level) or less must make a Saving Throw
vs. Death Ray or run away in fear.

often found near graveyards, dungeons,

Spitting Cobra: A spitting cobra is a 3’
long grayish-white snake which spits a
stream of venom at its victim’s eyes, up to a
distance of 6 feet away. If the spit hits, the
victim must make a Saving Throw vs. Poison
or be blinded. (This blindness can normally
be removed only by a Cure Blindness spell
from the D&D EXPERT rules, but the DM
may allow other methods.) As with most
small poisonous snakes, a spitting cobra will
not attack human-sized or larger opponents
unless startled or threatened. It can either
spit or bite in one round, but not both; it
will usually spit. The damage given (1-3
points) applies only to the bite; in this case,
the victim must make a Saving Throw VS.
Poison or die in 1-10 turns.
Giant Racer: This is an “average” type of
giant snake about 4’ long. It has no special
abilities, but is faster than most other types.
It is not poisonous, but its bite can be
dangerous in itself. Larger ones may be
found, averaging 2‘ long per Hit Die and
inflicting 1-8, 1-10, or even 2-12 points of
damage per bite.
Pit Viper: A pit viper is a 5‘ long greenish-gray poisonous snake with small pits in
its head. These pits act as heat sensors, with
a range of 60’. The combination of pits and
infravision makes it very hard to fight a pit
viper; it is so quick that it always gains the
initiative (no roll needed). Any victim bitten
by a pit viper must make a Saving Throw vs.
Poison or die.
Sea Snake: Sea snakes are snakes adapted
for living in the sea. All are poisonous. They
average 6‘ long, but can be much larger if
the DM desires (2’ long per Hit Die). A sea
snake’s bite is little more than a pinprick,
and will go unnoticed 50% of the time. The
victim must make a Saving Throw vs. Poison, and the poison is slow-acting; its full
effects take 3-6 turns to be felt if the Saving
Throw is failed. Unlike other snakes, sea
snakes will attack humans for food.
Giant Rattlesnake: A giant rattlesnake is
a 10’ long snake with brown and white scales
set in a diamond pattern. On its tail is a
dried, scaly rattle, which it often shakes to
ward off intruders or attackers who are too
large to eat. The victim of a giant rattlesnake bite must make a Saving Throw vs.
Poison or die in 1-6 turns. This snake is very
fast, and attacks twice per round, the second
attack coming at the end of the round.
Rock Python: This 20‘ long snake has
brown and yellow scales set in a spiral
pattern. Its first attack is a bite. If the bite is
successful, it coils around the victim and
constricts in the same round. This squeezing does 2-8 points of damage per round,
and occurs automatically if the bite hits.

All spiders can be dangerous, and many are
poisonous. All are carnivores, either trapping their prey in webs or jumping at victims by surprise. However, they are rarely
intelligent, and will often flee from fire.

Crab Spider: This is a 5‘ long spider with
a chameleon-like ability to blend into its
surroundings, surprising on a roll of 1-4 (on
ld6). It clings to walls or ceilings and drops
onto its prey. After the first attack, it can be
seen and attacked normally. Any victim of
its bite must make a Saving Throw vs.
Poison or die in 1-4 turns. However, the
poison is weak, and the victim gains a + 2
bonus to the Saving Throw roll.
Black Widow Spider: This vicious arachnid is 6’ long, and has a red “hourglass”
mark on its belly. It usually stays close to its
webbed lair. The webs should be treated as
the magic-user’s Web spell for the chances
of breaking free, once entrapped. The webs
may also be burned away. Any victim of the

Sprites are small winged people (about 1

shy, they are very curious and have a
strange sense of humor. Five sprites acting
together can cast one Curse spell. This will
take the form of a magic practicaljoke, such

imagination. Sprites will never cause death
on purpose even if they are attacked. (In the

bite of a black widow spider must make a

Tarantella: A tarantella is a huge hairy
magical spider which looks like a 7’ long
tarantula. Its bite does not kill; instead, it
causes the victim (if a Saving Throw vs.
Poison is failed) to have painful spasms
which resemble a frantic dance. This dance
has a magical effect on onlookers. Anyone
watching the dance must make a Saving
Throw vs. Spells or start to dance in the
same way. Dancing victims have a penalty of
-4 on their Hit Rolls, and attackers gain
+ 4 on their Hit Rolls. The effects of the
bite last for 2-12 turns. However, dancers
will drop from exhaustion in 5 turns, and
they will then be helpless against attacks.
Those caught while watching will dance as
long as the original victim. (In the D&D
EXPERT rules, there are magical means to
cure the poison, and a Dispel Magic spell
will stop the dance.)

D&D EXPERT rules, the effects of the
sprites’curse can be countered by a Remove

hobgoblins, and are sometimes found as

per round as long as it is alive. After a thoul
is hit, the DM should add 1 hit point to its

made. Nauseated characters have a -2
penalty on their Hit Rolls while in hand-tohand combat with .the troglodytes.

Undead (See Ghoul, Skeleton, Wight, or
Zombie: The Undead are evil creatures
created by dark magic. They are not affected by things that affect living creatures
(such as poison) or spells which affect the
mind (such as Sleep and Charm Person).
They make no noise.

A wight is an undead spirit living in the
body of a dead human or demi-human. It
can only be hit by silvered or magical weapons. Wights are greatly feared, as they drain
life energy when striking a victim. Each hit
drains one level of experience or Hit Die.
(Energy Drain is explained on page 24. Any
person totally drained of life energy by a
wight will become a wight in 1-4 days, and
will be under control of their slayer.

This deadly fungus covers an area of 10

though many may be found together.
Yellow mold can only be killed by fire: a
torch will do 1-4 points of damage to it each
round. It can eat through wood and leather
but cannot harm metal or stone. It does not
actually attack, but if it is touched, even by a
torch, the touch may (50% chance per
touch) cause the mold to squirt out a 10’ x

within the cloud will take 1-6 points of
damage and must make a Saving Throw vs.

Wolves: Wolves are carnivores, and hunt in
packs. Though they prefer the wilderness,
they may occasionally be found in caves.
Captured wolf cubs may be trained like
dogs (if the DM permits), but with difficulty.
If 3 or less wolves are encountered, or if a
pack is reduced to less than 50% of its
original numbers, their morale is 6 rather
than 8.

Dire Wolves: Dire wolves are larger and
more ferocious than normal wolves, and are
semi-intelligent. They are fierce enemies
and usually hunt in packs, found in caves,
woods, or mountains, They are sometimes
trained by goblins to be used as mounts.
Captured dire wolf cubs can be trained like
dogs (if the DM permits), but they are even
more savage than normal wolves.

Zombie

Zombies are mindless undead humans or
demi-humans animated by some evil magicuser or cleric. They may be Turned by
clerics but are not affected by Sleep or
Charm spells. They can be harmed by normal weapons. Zombies are often placed to
guard treasures, since they make no noise.
They are slow fighters, and always lose
initiative (no roll needed).

Treasure
The coins, gems, jewelry and magic items
found by the characters during an adventure are all called treasure. Wealth (coins,
gems, jewelry and other items of value) is
worth experience points. The amount of
treasure found will determine how fast the
characters advance. A wealthy character
may also buy better equipment, hire more
retainers, and purchase special services for example, buying magical cures from
higher level clerics. Magic items are not
counted for XP awards, but they are useful
in other ways, especially during adventures.
Treasure is normally found in the lairs
of monsters, but may be gained as payment
or a reward from a NPC for performing
some task. Treasures are determined randomly or chosen by the DM.
The DM should always determine the
contents of a large treasure hoard before
play, to decide how best to hide and protect
the treasure from theft. If magic items are
present, the DM may want to allow the
monsters to use the items - such as a
bugbear using a magical sword + 1.

Random Treasures
To determine a monster’s treasure at random, use the following step-by-step procedure:
HOW TO DETERMINE
RANDOM TREASURE
1. Find the Treasure Type
2. Of the possible treasures given for the
Treasure Type, roll d % to find which
ones are actually present.
3. Determine the amount of each treasure
resent.
4. ff magic is present, roll for the exact
items, using the Magic Subtables.

1. Find the Treasure Type in the monster
description. Find the same letter on the
Treasure Types Tables. The line after
that letter will be used to find the actual
treasure. Read across the Treasure
Type line to find the possible types of
treasure present. Each type will give a
percentage, followed by a range of
numbers. *

2. Using Percentage dice, if you roll a
number equal to or less than the percentage given, that type of treasure is
present. As you roll each percentage,
make a note (on scrap paper) of each
type of treasure actually present.

3. Roll the dice range to find the amount
of each type of treasure present (those
found in step 2).

4. If any magic items are present, the
Magic Item Subtables are used to find
the actual types.
Special Dice Note: The amount of treasure is listed as a range. Whenever the
range starts with “1” (1-4, 1-6), the last
number indicates the type of die rolled.
For example, 1-4 means ld4; 1-100 means
d%.
When the first number is larger than
one, it indicates the number of dice; the
type of dice must be found, usually by
dividing the second number by the first.
For example, 3-24 means 3d8; 2-24
means 2d12; 5-30 means 5d6.
If both numbers are multiples of 10,
the DM may roll one die and multiply
the result by 10. For example, 10-40 may
be determined by ld4, multiplied by 10;
10-60 may be determined by ld6x10.

Placed Treasures
You may choose treasures instead of rolling for them randomly. You may also
choose a result if rolls give too much or too
little treasure. These choices should be
40

+

Nil
40% 2-8 potions
50% 1-4 scrolls

made carefully, since most of the experience the characters will get will be from
treasure (usually V4 or more).
After running a few games, it may be
easier for you to first decide how many XP
to give out (considering the size and levels
of experience in the party), and place the
treasures to give the desired result. However, be sure to make the monsters tough
enough to force the characters to earn
their treasure!

Adjusting Treasure
When the “No. Appearing” of a type of
monster is 1-4, no adjustment is necessary;
even a single monster will have the treasure indicated. However, many human-like
monsters are found in large numbers in
their outdoor lairs. When the Treasure
Type given is a letter from A to 0, that
should only be the treasure found in a full
lair (the Wilderness No. Appearing - the
number in parentheses in the monster
description). Beginning characters should
not encounter full lairs of these creatures.
Encounters with less than a full lair should
yield less treasure.

Other Treasure Types

Gems

You may create Treasure Types other than
those listed. Some other valuable items
could be rugs, wall hangings, rare wines,
silverware and other kitchen items, or even
animal skins. You should give each item a
value in gold pieces (and an encumbrance,
if that optional rule is used).

To find the value of a gem, roll Percentage
dice and refer to the Gem Value Table:

Average Treasure Values
The average values of each Treasure Type
(in gp) are given below. These averages do
not include the possible magic in the treasures. After rolling for treasures, you may
refer to this list to see whether the treasure
is larger or smaller than average. You may
then adjust the treasure, if you wish.

Coins
All coins are about equal in size and

Electrum is a mixture of silver and gold.
The rate of exchange between coins is as
follows:

MONEY CONVERSION CHART
l0Ocp = 1 gp

2 ep = 1 gp
1 PP = 5 gP

500 CD = 50 SD = 10 eu = 5 ED = 1 DP

700-1000
1100-1400

Pendant, Necklace
Crown, Sceptre

As with gems, you may use any type of
jewelry as treasure, and various combinations. You may choose to allow jewelry of
greater value than that given.
When both gems and jewelry occur in
the same treasure, you may combine them.
For exumple, a single gem result of 1,000 gp
along with a jewelry value of 1,500 gp
could be placed as “two gold crowns, each
with a large pearl set in the front; each
crown is worth 1,250 gp.”

You may wish to reveal a gem type rather
than giving its exact value, for more realism in the adventure. If you do so, the
players should be able to discover the exact
value later - at the town jeweler’s shop,
for example (probably for a small fee,
which is usually 1-5%of the value, or less).

Optional: After finding the total value
of all the gems in a treasure, you may
combine or split them into different
numbers of gems at any values. For
example, 5 gems worth 100 gp each might
be placed as 1 pearl, or 50 onyx gems,
or 4 garnets and 10 pieces of turquoise.

Magic Item Subtables
If a magic item is present in a treasure, you
should find the exact item, using the following three-step process:
1. Roll Percentage dice to find which Subtable to use, as given on the Magic Item
Type Table.

2. Find the Subtable indicated and roll
Id20 to find the exact item.

3. Read the explanation of the item, given
on the following pages.

1. Roll Percentage:

Jewelry
To find the value of a piece of jewelry, roll
3d6 and multiply the total by 100 (for a
total of 300-1800 gp). Jewelry can be
damaged by such things as very hot fire,
lightning bolts, crushing, and other rough
treatment. Damaged jewelry is only worth
Yz normal value.

Identifying Magic Items

e. SCROLLS (roll ld20)

The only way to identify exactly what an
item does is by testing it (trying on the ring,
sipping the potion, etc.). If a retainer does
this testing, the retainer will expect to keep
the item. A high level NPC magic-user may
be asked to identify an item, but will want
money or a service in advance and may
take several weeks (game time, not real
time) to do it.

There are two basic types of magic items:
Permanent items, which are not used up
(such as swords and armor), and Temporary items, which are used either once
(such as potions) or one “charge” at a time
(such as wands).

42

.

Any magic item must be properly used to
have any effect. A magic shield will have no
effect unless it is carried normally; a ring
must be worn on a finger to get the magical
effect.
Some Permanent items are simply for
protection. No concentration is required to
use these items. Magic weapons also function automatically.
All Temporary items are either consumed (by drinking or eating) or used by
concentrating. If not consumed, the item
must be held while the user concentrates.
While using the item, the user may not
move, cast a spell, or take any other action
during that round.

Charges in Magic Items
Many Temporary items have a limited
number of charges (uses). When the last
charge is used, the item is no longer magical. It is not possible to find out how many
charges an item has, and such items cannot
be recharged.

Magic Item Descriptions:
a. swords
When a magic sword is used, the player
adds the “plus” to both Hit Rolls and
Damage rolls. Several swords also have a
special adjustment which is used onb when
fighting a special type of opponent. Normal weapon restrictions for character
classes also apply to magical weapons. For
example, A cleric cannot use a sword, so a
cleric cannot use a magical sword either.
Two of the swords listed can cast cleric
spells. Refer to those spells to find the
exact effect. Each effect can only be used
once each adventure (or day). No meditating is needed to gain the spell casting
ability. If you wish, you may add other spell
abilities to swords, using either cleric or
magic-user spells.
You may select the size of a sword (most
are normal swords, but short and twohanded swords may be found) or determine it randomly.

Cursed Swords: Any sword may be
cursed! When the dice rolls indicate a
sword as treasure, roll Id20 again. If the
result is 1-3, a cursed sword should be placed
instead. However, it will seem to be a
“normal” magic sword (whatever type was
first rolled) until used in deadly combat. At
that time, the curse is revealed.

Treasure
A cursed sword will cause the player to
subtract one from all Hit Rolls and Damage
Rolls when using that weapon, instead of
giving a bonus. Once a cursed sword is
used in battle, it may not be thrown away.
If it is stolen or sold, the character is cursed
with the desire to get it back. The character
will always use that weapon when in battle.
(DM, tell the player that this is what the
character wants - and no arguments!)
Only a high level NPC magic-user or cleric
can help a character be rid of the curse.
After the curse is removed, the sword will
become a “normal” magic sword, of whatever type was rolled.

b. OtherWeapons
As with magic swords, the “plus” number is
added to both Hit Rolls and Damage Rolls.
And as with swords, any item may be cursed,
though there is less chance with other weap
ons. Roll ld20; if the result is 1-2, the item is
cursed. The curse is handled in the same
manner as a cursed sword.
Normal weapon restrictions apply. Since
a magic-user cannot use a sling, a magicuser cannot use a magical sling, either.

c. Armor
Armor comes in many shapes and sizes.
The better the armor, the lower your AC
number. Magical armor and shields can
lower the AC number even further.

Explanation of Magical Armor Table:
“Normal AC” is the AC of a character
wearing normal armor of the type given.
“Magical AC” is the AC of a character
wearing magical armor of the type given.
“Encumbrance Adjustment” is the
added amount that a character can carry
when wearing magical armor of the type
given. In other words, magical chain mail
weighs 250 cn less than non-magical chain
mail armor.
A shield + 1 would lower the AC number one more. For example, a fighter in
normal chain mail and shield would be AC
4. If a set of magical chain mail and shield
were found (both l), the AC would drop
1 for the armor and 1 more for the shield,
for a total of AC 2. If a + 2 shield were
used, the AC number would drop 1 more,
for a total of AC 1.

+

Cursed Armor: Armor and shields may be
cursed! You should roll ld8 when either is
placed as treasure; a result of 1 indicates
that the item is cursed. Handle cursed
armor in the same manner as cursed
swords. Cursed armor makes a character
easier to hit by 1.
You may either select the size of the
armor found (most is human-sized) or
determine it randomly.

+

d. Potions
Potions are usually found in small glass
vials, similar to Holy Water. Each potion
has a different smell and taste - even two
potions with the same effect! Unless stated
otherwise, the effect of a potion lasts 7-12
turns. Only you, the DM, should know the
exact duration, and you should keep track
of it when the potion is used. The entire
potion must be drunk to have this effect. A
potion may be sipped to discover its type
and then used later. Drinking a potion
takes one round. Sipping a potion does not
decrease its effect or duration.
If a character drinks a potion while
another potion is still in effect, that character will become sick and will be unable to
do anything (no saving throw) for 3 turns
(Y2 hour) and neither potion will have any
further effect. A potion of healing has no
duration (for this calculation).Each type of
potion is described below:

Diminution: Anyone taking this potion
will immediately shrink to 6 in height, and
can do no damage when physically attacking a creature larger than 1’. The user can
slip through small cracks and has a 90%
chance of not being seen when standing
still. This potion will negate a potion of
growth.
ESP This potion will have the same effect
as the magic-user spell ESP. The user may
“hear” the thoughts (if any) of one creature
within 60‘ by concentrating for one full
turn in one direction. The user may “hear”
through 2 feet of rock, but a thin coating
of lead will block the ESP. Refer to the
magic-user spell (PLAYERS MANUAL,
page 41) for more information.
Gaseous Form: Upon drinking this potion,
the user’s body will take the form of a cloud
of gas. Anything the user is carrying or
wearing will fall through the gaseous body
to land on the floor. The user will keep
control over his or her body, and can move
through small holes in walls, chests, and so
forth. Any creature or character in gaseous
form cannot attack, but has an AC of - 2
and cannot be harmed by non-magical
weapons.

Growth: This potion causes the user to
grow to twice normal size, temporarily
increasing Strength and giving the ability
to inflict double damage (twice the amount
rolled) on any successful hit. The user’s hit
points, however, will not increase. This
potion will negate a potion of diminution.

Healing: Like the clerical cure light
wounds s ell, drinking this potion will
restore 2-y lost hit points or will cure
paralysis for one creature.
Invisibility: This potion will have the same
effects as the magic-user spell invisibility.
The potion will make the user invisible.
When a character becomes invisible, all the
items (but not other creatures) carried and
worn by that character also become invisible. Any invisible item will become visible
once again when it leaves the character’s
possession (is set down, dropped, and so
forth). See the magic-user spell (page 41) of
the PLAYERS’ MANUAL) for more information. The DM may allow players to
drink small amounts of this potion 6 times,
each drink being effective but only for 1
turn.
Levitation: Drinking this potion will have
the same effects as the magic-user spell
levitation. The user may move up or down
in the air without any support. This potion
does not enable the user to move side-toside. The user could, however, levitate to a
ceiling and move sideways by pushing or
pulling. Motion up or down is at a rate of
60’ per round. See the magic-user spell
(page 41 of the PLAYERS MANUAL) for
more information.
Poison: Poisons look like n ormal magic
potions. If any amount of t his potion is
swallowed, even a sip, the usc:r must make
a Saving Throw vs. Poison o r die! (If you
wish, you may decide that thle poison will
do a set amount of damage if the Saving
Throw is failed.)

e. Scrolls
A scroll is a piece of old payier or parchment upon which a high levc:1 magic-user,
elf or cleric has written a ma5$tal formula.
To use a scroll, there must be enough light
to read by, and the scroll rnust be read
aloud. A scroll can only be u sed once, for
the words will fade from thc3 scroll when
they are read aloud. A spell SIcroll can only
be read by a magic-user, IElf, or cleric
(depending on the type of spell), but a
Protection Scroll or a Treasure Map can be
read by anyone.

Treasure
Spell Scroll: These scrolls may have 1,2, or
3 spells written on them. If more than one
spell is written on a scroll, only the spell
cast will disappear when read. Spell scrolls
may have either magic-user or cleric spells
on them. To find the type, roll ld4:

Cleric spell
Magic-user spell

Magic-user spells are written in a magical
language and cannot be read until a Read
Magic spell (PLAYERS’ MANUAL, page
40) is used to read it. Cleric scrolls are
written in the Common tongue but only a
cleric will understand how to use the spells.
Magic-users and elves cannot use cleric
scrolls, nor can clerics read magic-user
scrolls.
You may either choose the spells on a
Scroll or determine them randomly. If you
wish to choose them randomly, roll Id6 for
each spell and use the chart below to find
the spell level. Then roll to determine the
exact spell, using the spell lists (PLAYERS’
MANUAL, page 35, or page 17 of this
booklet for 3rd level spells).

5. The reader’s Prime Requisite must be
rerolled.
6. Wounds will take twice as long to heal,
and healing spells only restore half normal amounts.
Only a Remove Curse spell (see the D&D
EXPERT SET) can remove a curse of this
nature. However, you may allow the cursed
character to be cured by a high level NPC
cleric or magic-user, who will demand that
the character complete a special adventure
or perform a worthy but difficult task.

Protection Scroll: A protection scroll may
be read and used by any class. When read,
it creates a circle of protection 10’ across
which will move with the reader at its
center. It will prevent any of the given
creatures from entering this circle, but
does not prevent spell or missile attacks
from those creatures. The circle will be
broken if anyone protected attacks one of
the given creatures in hand-to-hand combat.
Protectionfrom Lycanthropes: When read, this
scroll will protect all those within the circle
from a variable number of lycanthropes
for 6 turns. The number of lycanthropes
affected varies according to their type, as
follows:

LEVEL OF SPELL ON SCROLL

Cursed Scroll: Unfortunately, when any
writing on a cursed scroll is even seen, the
victim is immediately cursed. No reading is
necessary! You, the DM, must make up
each curse. Examples of a few common
curses are:
The reader turns into a frog (or some
other harmless animal).
A wandering monster of the same level
as the reader appears and attacks the
reader by surprise (a free attack with
bonuses).
One magic item owned by the reader
disappears (the item is chosen or randomly determined by the DM).
The reader loses one level of experience, as if struck by a wight. (You
should roll again for a first level character, to avoid unfair “instant death.”)

Wererats:
Werewolves, wereboars:
Weretigers, werebears:

1-10 affected
1-8 affected
1-4 affected

Protection f r m Undead: When read, this
scroll will protect all those within the circle
from a variable number of undead for 6
turns. The number of undead affected
varies according to their type, as follows:

Skeletons, zombies,
or ghouls:
Wights, wraiths,
or mummies:
Spectres (or larger):

2-24 affected
2-12 affected
1-6 affected

Treasure Map: A treasure map should be
made by the DM in advance, and should
show the location of some treasure hoard
in a dungeon. The DM may choose any
combination of treasures to equal the total
value given. These treasures should be
guarded by monsters. Sometimes maps are
only partially complete, or are written in
the form of riddles, and can only be read
by using a Read Languages spell.

44

f. Rings
A magical ring must be worn on a finger or
thumb to be used. A ring may also be
carried and put on when desired. Only one
magic ring can be worn on each hand. If
more than that are worn, none of the rings
will function, with the exception of a ring of
weakness (see below). Any ring may be used
by any character class.

Animal Control: The wearer of this ring
may command 1-6 normal animals (or 1
giant-sized).The animals are not allowed a
Saving Throw. The ring will not control
intelligent animal races or fantastic or magical monsters. The wearer must be able to
see the animals to control them. The control will last as long as the wearer concentrates on the animals and does not move or
fight. When the wearer stops concentrating, the animals will be free to attack their
controller or run away (roll reactions with a
penalty of -1 on the roll). This ring can
only be used once per turn.
Fire Resistance: The wearer of this ring
will not be harmed by normal fires, and
gains a bonus of 2 on all Saving Throws
vs. Fire Spells and vs. Red Dragon breath.
In addition, the DM must subtract 1 point
from each die of fire damage to the wearer
(with a minimum damage of 1 point per
die rolled to determine the damage).

+

Invisibility: The wearer is invisible as long
as the ring is worn. If the wearer attacks or
casts spells, he or she will become visible.
The wearer can only become invisible once
per turn.
Protection +1: This ring improves the
wearer’s Armor Class by 1. For example, a
magic-user with no armor (AC 9) would be
AC 8 when wearing the ring. This item
also adds a bonus of $1 to all of the
wearer’s Saving Throw rolls.
Water Walking: The wearer of this ring
may walk on the surface of any body of
water, and will not sink.
Weakness: When this ring is put on, the
wearer becomes weaker, and his or her
Strength score becomes 3 within 1-6
rounds. The wearer cannot take off this
ring (unless a Remove Curse spell is used,
as explained in the D&D EXPERT rules).

Treasure
g. Wands, Staves, and Rods
A wand is a thin smooth stick about 18
inches long. A rod is similar, but 3 feet
long; and a staff is 2 inches thick and about
6 feet long. In D&D BASIC rules, wands
may only be used by magic-users and elves,
and staves may only be used by clerics.
(More of these items, with different
charges and usable by different classes, are
given in the EXPERT Set.) A wand contains 1-10 charges when found. Each item is
described below:
Wand of Enemy Detection: When a
charge is used, this item will cause all
enemies within 60’ (even those hidden or
invisible) to glow, as if on fire.
Wand of Magic Detection: When a charge
is used, this item will cause any magic item
within 20’ to glow. If the item cannot
normally be seen (within a closed chest, for
example), the glow will not be seen.

is treated as having an Armor Class of 9.
The DM may adjust the Armor Class of an
item if it is being used in combat (such as
when trying to hit a sword).

The wearer becomes visible when attacking or casting a spell, and may not become
invisible again for a full turn.

h. Miscellaneous Magic Items

Elven Boots: The wearer of these boots
may move with nearly complete silence
(roll ld10; only heard on a 1).

Each of these items is special, and is fully
described below.

Bag of Devouring: This item looks like a
normal small sack, but anything placed
within it disappears. Anyone may reach in
and find the contents by touch - if the
contents are still there! If the contents are
not removed witin 7-12 turns, they will be
forever lost. The bag will not affect living
creatures unless the entire creature is
stuffed inside the bag. This is impossible to
do except with very small creatures.

Wand of Paralyzation: This wand projects
a cone-shaped ray when a charge is used.
The ray is 60‘ long and 30’ wide at its end.
Any creature struck by the ray must make
a Saving Throw vs. Wands or be paralyzed
for 6 turns.
points of damage per use. It may only be
used once per day on each person, but will
heal any number of persons once a day. It
does not have nor use any charges.

Rod of Cancellation: This rod is usable by
any character. It will only work once, but
will drain any magic item it hits, making
that item forever non-magical. The target

Helm of Alignment Changing: This item
looks like a fancy helmet. When the helm is
put on, it will immediately change the
wearer’s alignment (the DM should determine the new alignment randomly). This
device may only be taken off by using a
Remove Curse spell, and the wearer will
resist the removal. Once removed, the
wearer’s original alignment will return.
The DM may allow the character to remove it by performing a special task or
adventure.
Helm of Telepathy: This item looks like a
fancy helmet. The wearer of this helm may
send messages, by mere thought, to any
creature within 90’. The creature receiving
the thought messages will understand
them. (The creature may refuse to respond.) The wearer may also read the
thoughts of a living creature within range.
To make the helm work, the wearer must
concentrate on the creature, and may not
move or cast spells. If the creature fails‘a
Saving Throw vs. spells (or permits the
thought reading), the wearer will understand the creature’s thoughts.

Staff of Healing: This item will heal 2-7

Snake Staff: This magical staff is a Staff
$1, and will inflict 2-7 points of damage
per hit.
Upon command, it turns into a snake
(AC 5 , Hit Dice 3, hit points 20, Movement
60’ per turn, 20‘ per round) and coils
around the creature struck. The command
may be spoken when the victim is hit. The
victim is allowed to make a Saving Throw
vs. Spells to avoid the serpent’s coil. Any
man-sized or smaller victim will be held
helpless for 1-4 turns (unless the snake is
ordered by the owner to release the victim
before that time). Larger creatures cannot
be “coiled.”
When freed, the snake crawls back to its
owner and becomes a staff once again. The
snake is completely healed when it turns
into a staff. If killed in snake form, it will
not return to staff form and loses all magical properties. This item does not have nor
use any charges.

Gauntlets of Ogre Power: These gauntlets
will give the wearer a Strength score of 18,
gaining all normal bonuses. If a weapon is
not used in combat, the wearer may strike
with one fist each round, for 1-4 points of
damage and gaining a + 3 on Hit Rolls
(only).

Bag of Holding: This item looks like a
normal small sack, but anything placed
within it disappears. Anyone may reach in
and find the contents by touch. The bag
will actually hold treasures up to 10,000cn
in weight, but will only weigh 600 cn when
full. An item to be placed inside the bag
may be no larger than 10’ x 5’ x 3’. A
larger item will not fit inside.
Crystal Ball: This item can only be used by
an elf or magic-user. Its owner may look
into it and see any place or object thought
of. It will work 3 times per day, and the
image will only last for 1turn. Spells cannot
be cast “through” the crystal ball. The
more familiar the object or area to be seen,
the clearer the picture will be.
Elven Cloak: The wearer of this cloak is
nearly invisible (roll ld6; seen only on a 1).

45

Medallion of ESP: This magical medallion
is strung on a chain to be worn around the
neck. If the wearer concentrates for 1
round, he or she may read the thoughts of
any one creature within 30‘. The wearer
may move normally but cannot fight nor
cast spells while concentrating. The DM
must roll ld6 each time this item is used; it
will not work properly on a roll of 1. If this
occurs, it hill broadcast the thoughts of the
user to everyone within 30’! The DM may
allow a Saving Throw vs. Spells to prevent
the medallion from reading a creature’s
thoughts.
Rope of Climbing: This 50’ long, thin,
strong rope will climb in any direction
upon the command of the owner. It may
fasten itself to any protruding surface, and
will support up to 10,000 cn of weight.

Creating dungeons
A “dungeon” is any place where monsters
and treasures may be found. A dungeon is
usually a group of rooms, connected by
corridors. It could be a castle (new or
ruined), some caves, or anything else you
can imagine.
The “level” of a dungeon is a number
that identifies part of the dungeon, and
usually indicates the amount of danger
present in that area of the dungeon. Level
One, or the “first level,” is usually the
easiest part of the dungeon - the place
where the smallest monsters and treasures
can be found. Level 2 is usually more
dangerous than level 1, and as the numbers
increase, so does the danger. A dungeon
may have any number of levels.

Types of Dungeons
The levels of a dungeon are usually built
vertically - one above the other. In most
dungeons, the deeper you go, the more
dangerous the adventure becomes. The
entrance to the dungeon is usually on
Level One, and stairs, pits, or chutes
(sometimes even elevators) lead to the
lower levels.
Some dungeons may be built in the
opposite way, with the more difficult levels
above the first, rather than below. A tower
is one example of this type.
Some dungeons may be built horizontally, with no areas above or below the first.
A “lower level” would be a section of the
dungeon further from the entrance, but
no deeper o r higher than the First Level. A
group of caves is an example of this type.
There may be more than one entrance
to a dungeon. All the entrances need not
lead to the First Level. Some may lead
directly to other levels, bypassing the first.
When you design a dungeon, you may
use any method. It is recommended that
you make simple vertical dungeons first,
with more dangerous levels below the first
level. You may find other types in published modules, and you may construct
more elaborate types after some practice.

Good and Bad Dungeons
You could “design” a dungeon simply by
drawing a group of circles and squares (for
rooms), connecting them by lines (for corridors), and making a list of monsters and
treasures to be found. But this random
“design” is not a good dungeon. A good
dungeon is reasonable. Its design is carefully thought out, and the monsters and
treasures are placed for a reason.
A good dungeon is more than just a
place to meet monsters; it provides entertainment, puzzles and clues, and fits together in a meaningful way. In a good
dungeon, the players gain a sense of

achievement - of successfully meeting a
challenge of some kind.
Even a random dungeon could be a
good dungeon, if the monsters within it
were selected and placed carefully. Randomly drawn caves would give a disorganized design of rooms and corridors, but
could be a good dungeon if occupied only
by cave dwellers, such as animals (normal
and giant) and human-like monster tribes
(such as goblins).
The Solo Adventure in the PLAYERS’
MANUAL was not a “good dungeon -at
least, not for most adventures! Instead,
that dungeon was designed as an exercise
for practicing your combat procedures,
and to show you several basic parts of the
game. It could be changed into a good
dungeon for group games by removing the
Rust Monster and adding more rooms to
complete an overall plan - possibly the
lair of a goblin tribe, with a few scavengers
(such as the rats) and guards (the skeletons) in the outer areas.

Step By Step
The following steps can be used as a guide
in making a good dungeon. Read them for
ideas, and follow the steps if you wish.
Every step is important.

1. Choose a Scenario
2. Decide on a Setting
3. Select Special Monsters
4. Draw the Map
5. Stock the Dungeon
6. Fill In the Final Details
1. Choose A Scenario
A “scenario”is an idea or theme which ties
the dungeon together. The entire dungeon should fit the scenario. A good scenario gives the players a reason for adventuring, and keeps the adventure consistent
and logical. The monsters and treasures
are placed later, based on the scenario
used. In short -the scenario affects everything in the dungeon.
A scenario can be anything you can
imagine! Some examples are given and
explained below.

Exploring the Unknown
The party is hired to map unknown territory. The area might once have been familiar but is now overrun or destroyed. A
strange tower might mysteriously appear
overnight in a familiar area. Examples:
TSRs Dungeon Modules B-1 and B-3.
Investigating an Enemy Outpost
The enemies (possibly Chaotic monsters)
are invading the Realm of Man. The characters must enter an enemy outpost, find
46

the strengths and plans of the invaders,
and destroy them if possible. Example:
TSRs Dungeon Module B-2.

Recovering Ruins
The party is scouting an old village before
permanent settlers move in. The ruins may
have been overrun by a certain type of
monster, who must be driven off or slain.
The ruins could even be underneath - or
part of - a thriving town.
Destroying an Ancient Evil
The “evil” is a monster or NPC, but the
exact type is not known. It may have been
deeply buried and reawakened by recent
digging, exploring, and so forth.
Visiting a Lost Shrine
To remove a curse or recover a special item,
the party must travel to a shrine which has
been lost for ages. They have only a rough
idea of its location, and may have to consult
an oracle or seer during the trip.
Fulfilling a Quest
A King (or other powerful NPC) assigns an
epic task to a character or party. It may
involve the recovery of a valuable or
powerful object.
Escaping From Enemies
The characters have been captured! They
must escape from their cells deep within a
dungeon. (Be sure to make escape, and the
recovery of some equipment, possible though not easy.)
Rescuing Prisoners
Valuable or important persons are being
held prisoner by an evil group (bandits,
orcs, a magic-user with allies, etc.). The
party may be hired, or may simply be
seeking an announced reward. The party
may be the guards for a person negotiating
the ransom demands.
Using a Magic Portal
A “magic portal” is a device which magically sends creatures from one place to
another. It may be a “door” into another
dimension or world, and could become the
point of an invasion from the far place! It
could simply be a way to force the party
into a secret part of a dungeon. The party
might be on a mission to destroy the portal,
or might be hired to reopen or find a
closed or lost portal. The portal may be
known or secret, and may operate both
ways - or one-way only!
Finding a Lost Race
The characters find a long-lost race that
was once human, but has lived underground so long that many changes have
occurred (change of color, animal habits,

Creating dungeons
infravision, etc.). The details of the Lost
Race must be invented carefully.

2. Decide on a Setting
You do not yet have to make a full map of
the dungeon, but you should decide how
the area will generally look. After choosing a
general type (some are given below), make
notes on any specific ideas you have for
special rooms or areas.

Castle or Tower
Caves or Cavern
Abandoned mine

Crypt or Tomb
Ancient Temple
Stronghold or Town

3. Select Special Monsters
You should select (and not roll at random)
some special monsters, based on the scenario. You may create new monsters if
desired. For example, if the scenario is “Recovering Ruins” in a “Ruined Town” setting, you might place a few hobgoblin lairs
(15-20 creatures in each), plus their pets
and friends, as Special Monsters. The rest
of the ruins could be filled randomly. The
entire “dungeon” could be used for several
adventures.
4. Draw the Map

Using graph paper and pencil, draw a map
of the dungeon. First, select a scale. The
scale of a map is the number of feet (length
and area) represented by one square on
the paper. A common scale is “1 square =
10’ x 10’ area.” For outdoor areas, like the
ruins mentioned above, a 20’ x 20’ map
square is common. Some detailed indoor
areas use 5’ x 5‘ squares, but any scale may
be used.
Second, draw the overall shape of the
dungeon, based on the setting. For caves,
no exact shape is needed; you could simply
draw a line for the outer edge, break it with
a few entrances, and fill the rest of the map
paper with rooms and corridors. For a
tower, however, you must decide on a size
and shape before continuing.
Some sections of the map may be left
blank, to be filled in later.
The standard symbols used in mapping
to represent doors, stairs, traps, and other
features are given on the inside front
cover. You can get several ideas for dungeon design just from looking at them!

5. Stock the Dungeon
The process of placing the monsters, traps,
and treasures into the dungeon is called
“stocking” the dungeon. First, place the
Special Monsters in their areas, along with
their treasures. Then you may either select
other creatures or roll for them at random,

using either the Wandering Monster Tables (inside back cover) or a list of your
own.
To randomly determine the contents of
rooms, you may use the system explained
on the following pages.

then read across to the column under the
result of the second roll. If the result is “T,”
place treasure in the room. Treasure is
rarely found with a “Special.” The amount
of treasure can be determined by using the
random Treasures Table:

6. Fill In the Final Details

Silver pieces are always part of randomly
placed treasure, and other items might be
found. The DM rolls Percentage dice, and
if the result is equal to or less than the
number given, that type of treasure is also
present. Treasure should rarely be sitting
out on the floor. You should decide where
the treasure is kept (a locked chest) or
hidden (in a hollow table leg, etc.).

After the rooms have been stocked, you
can add details about normal items,
sounds, smells, and so forth. Try to add
enough detail to make the adventure interesting, but not too much that the players
become bored. You will develop a “feel,” in
time, for the right amount of detail.
To finish, you should make a Wandering
Monster list to fit the dungeon. Only a few
monsters will be needed - from 4 to 10 but they should be selected to fit the scenario,
the setting, and the map. For example,in ruins,
the Wandering Monsters could all be scavenger types (carrion crawler, rats, gelatinous
cube), giant beetle, and Special Monsters (1-4
hobgoblin guards, for example).

Random Stocking
After placing Special Monsters in a dungeon, you may fill the rest of a dungeon
with creatures either at random or by
choosing. Many rooms should be left
empty. If there are creatures everywhere,
the dungeon will be too dangerous. As a
way of checking, imagine what would happen in the dungeon when the adventurers
aren’t around. If the monsters would encounter each other often, they should not
be enemies; otherwise, the dungeon could
be ruined! It would be nearly empty before
the adventurers arrive, with all the dungeon treasure in the lair of the last survivors.
To randomly stock a dungeon room, roll
ld6 twice and consult the Room Contents
Table. The first roll is to find the contents
(monster, trap, special, or empty), and the
second roll shows whether treasure is present.

The Random Stocking chart may call for
the placement of a Trap or Special. These
are explained below.

Trap

A trap is anything that could cause
damage, delay or a magical effect to occur.
The trap may be found, and possibly removed, by a thief character. Traps may be
placed on doors, walls, ceilings, room furnishings (table, chest, etc.) or directly on a
treasure. You may combine traps, or place
several in one area, but try not to make the
encounter too dangerous for the characters. Deadly traps are not recommended
until the 2nd level of a dungeon (or
deeper) is reached. Some typical traps:
Blade: A blade sweeps out, down, or up,
hitting someone (possibly allowing a Saving
Throw) for damage.
Creature: A monster (snake,beetle, spider,
etc.) jumps up and gets 1 free attack by
surprise.
Darts: Some tiny darts, shot by a spring
mechanism, shoot out and hit someone
(either automatic hits or by making Hit
Rolls), for damage or some other effect
(paralysis, poison, curse, etc.).
Explosion: Something blows up, causing
damage to everyone in the area - any set
amount or dice range, but a Saving Throw
vs. Spells should allow damage to be reduced to half unless the explosion is an
illusion.

Creating dungeons
Falling Items: A block (or rubble) falls
when something is touched (or at random),
striking someone and allowing a Saving
Throw vs. Wands (for trying to jump out
of the way) for damage (either a given
number or a dice range).
Fog: Looks like poison gas, but a failed
Saving Throw results in (pick one):
nothing, giggles, fear, a terrible smell for
1-6 turns (which may attract monsters or
increase Wandering Monster chances), anger (victims attack each other for 1-4
rounds; a Saving Throw may be applied),
or paralysis.
Illusion: Something strange happens (but
not really; see Phantasmal Force, a magicuser’s spell), and the characters may be
scared away (or the illusion may have some
other effect, such as giving a false clue,
luring characters toward another trap,
etc.).
Light: A bright light flashes, and all seeing
it are blinded for a time (a Saving Throw
vs. Spells should apply, possibly with a
bonus or penalty to the roll).
Pit: A section of floor gives way, and (one,
some, or all) characters fall in, taking (ld4,
ld6, ld8, ld10) damage. The pit may have
something at the bottom (spikes for more
damage, deep water, or a monster).
It may be a chute, leading down (a oneway ride) to the next dungeon level.
Poison Gas: Victims make Saving Throws
vs. Poison or take damage (ld4, ld6, or
whatever is dangerous but not deadly to
most characters). 0 tionally, a Saving
Throw vs. Poison wit bonuses (+ 1, 2,
+4) to the roll may be made, with failure
meaning death. Gas is usually in a container, released when opened.

hp

+

Poison Needle: This is a small needle,
hidden somewhere and nearly undetectable until accidentally touched, when it will
spring out and poke a character who tries
to open something.

special
A “special” is anything you place which is
not normal, but is not a trap, monster, or
treasure. Some typical specials are:

Alarm: Summons special monster, opens
dungeon doors, or has no effect at all.
Illusion: A dungeon feature (stairs, room,
door, monster, treasure, etc.) is not really
there, but is merely a phantasm.

Map Change: A shifting wall moves after .
the party passes, cutting off their exit.
They must find another way out of the
dungeon. The wall shifts back after a time
(1 turn, 1 hour, 1 day).
Movement: The room (or stairs, or door,
or item) moves (turns, drops, closes, rises,
etc.) unexpectedly. It might be stopped if a
roll for surprise (often with - 1, - 2, or - 3
penalty) shows that the party reacts quickly
enough to prevent it.

Pool: Magical water has a strange effect if
touched (or drunk, or sprinkled on someone or something), such as healing, inflicting damage, changing an Ability Score,
changing Alignment, making something
magical for a time, invisible for a time, etc.
Sounds: The room (or item, or treasure)
makes strange noises: moaning, screaming,
talking, etc.
Statue: A large statue of a person, monster,
or gadget (nearly anything you can imagine) is found. It may be valuable, magical,
too heavy to move, alive, lonesome and
willing to talk (maybe a liar), covering a
trap door down, a treasure, etc.
Transportation: This could be a trap door
leading up or down, secret stairs, elevator,
magical portal to elsewhere (another room,
another level, another dungeon), etc.
Trick Monster: This applies to any variation of a listed monster, such as: a skeleton
who shoots its fingertips like a Magic Missile, a two-headed giant ogre, a “goop”
dragon that spits green slime or grey ooze,
a wild bore (a shaggy man who tells long,
dreary stories), a quarterling (half-sized
halfling), a Mouth Harpy (who can’t sing
but plays the harmonica), an Ogre Jelly
(looks like an ogre, but . . .) Rock and Roll
Baboon, and so forth.
Weird Things: You may let your imagination run, placing such things as: weapons
which fly - attacking by themselves, talking skulls, a magic item or treasure firmly
stuck to the floor (or wall, or ceiling), a
magical area (zero gravity, reversed gravity,
growth to double size, shrink to 1” tall;
effect lasts until leaving the area), a huge
creature recently slain (too big to fit
through the corridors - “But how did it
get here?”), and so forth.

Wandering Monsters
In a dungeon, monsters are often encountered in rooms. The rooms may be their
lairs, or the creatures may simply be “passing through,” having lairs elsewhere.
48

These encounters are with “Placed”
monsters - creatures mentioned, in the
dungeon description, as being in one specific place. However, monsters may also
wander around, and be encountered during their travels. The DM does not place
these creatures in any one spot. Instead,
they are listed in a special Wandering
Monster Table, included with the dungeon
description. This chart is part of the design
of most dungeons.
One Wandering Monster Table may be
used for an entire dungeon, or separate
lists may be made for each level of the
dungeon. Some sample charts for dungeon levels 1-3 are given below.
During the adventure, the DM keeps
track of the passage of time. To find out if
Wandering Monsters appear, the DM rolls
l d 6 aft.. every tzuo turns. If the result is a 1,
one or more Wandering Monsters are approaching the party.
The creatures may be approaching from
any direction. A direction may simply be
chosen by the DM, depending on the location of the characters, or may be selected
randomly. The creature will arrive shortly
(1-4 minutes) after the roll indicates Wandering Monsters. They mignt arrive while
another encounter is in progress!
Some actions or items may increase the
chances of Wandering Monsters. Loud
noises, battles, cursed items, or exploring
special areas may result in a roll to check
for Wandering Monsters every turn, and
possibly with higher chances (1-2, 1-3, or
1-4 on ld6).
Generally, the number of Wandering
Monsters appearing should be less than
the normal Number Appearing given in
the monster description. As a guideline,
use the adjusted No. Appearing as if encountered on an easier level of the dungeon. For example, 2-8 Goblins (first level
monsters) are normally encountered on
Dungeon Level 1. If encountered as Wandering Monsters on the same level, only 1-6
or 1-4 goblins might be met.
To use the Wandering Monster Tables
given, find the table for the dungeon level
being explored. Then roll ld20, and find
the result on the chart used. The name
and number of the Wandering Monsters
encountered is given next to the result.
The “Number Appearing” has been adjusted both for level differences and for
Wandering (vs. placed). Find the full description of the monster, on the page number of this book given, for more information.
