echo "====================================================================="
echo

echo "✅ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE!"
echo

echo "📁 New Files Created:"
echo "   📄 LocationContext.java - Rich location data model"
echo "   🏗️  LocationContextManager.java - Core context management service"
echo "   🧪 LocationContextExample.java - Complete working demonstration"
echo "   📖 LOCATION_CONTEXT_IMPLEMENTATION.md - Technical documentation"
echo "   🧪 test-location-context.sh - Testing script for new features"
echo

echo "🔧 Enhanced Files:"
